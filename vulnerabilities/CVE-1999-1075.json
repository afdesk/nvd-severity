  "Description": "inetd in AIX 4.1.5 dynamically assigns a port N when starting ttdbserver (ToolTalk server), but also inadvertently listens on port N-1 without passing control to ttdbserver, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of connections to port N-1, which are not properly closed by inetd.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
