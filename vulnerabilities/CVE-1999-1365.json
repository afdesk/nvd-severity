  "Description": "Windows NT searches a user's home directory (%systemroot% by default) before other directories to find critical programs such as NDDEAGNT.EXE, EXPLORER.EXE, USERINIT.EXE or TASKMGR.EXE, which could allow local users to bypass access restrictions or gain privileges by placing a Trojan horse program into the root directory, which is writable by default.",
