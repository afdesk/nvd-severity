  "Description": "SonicWALL Tele2 and SOHO firewalls with 6.0.0.0 firmware using IPSEC with IKE pre-shared keys do not allow for the use of full 128 byte IKE pre-shared keys, which is the intended design of the IKE pre-shared key, and only support 48 byte keys.  This allows a remote attacker to brute force attack the pre-shared keys with significantly less resources than if the full 128 byte IKE pre-shared keys were used.",
