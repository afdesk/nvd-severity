  "Description": "htcgibin.exe in Lotus Domino server 5.0.9a and earlier allows remote attackers to determine the physical pathname for the server via requests that contain certain MS-DOS device names such as com5, such as (1) a request with a .pl or .java extension, or (2) a request containing a large number of periods, which causes htcgibin.exe to leak the pathname in an error message.",
