  "Description": "Integer signedness error in select() on OpenBSD 3.1 and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary kernel memory via a negative value for the size parameter, which satisfies the boundary check as a signed integer, but is later used as an unsigned integer during a data copying operation.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
