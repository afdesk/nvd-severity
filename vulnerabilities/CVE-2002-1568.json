  "Description": "OpenSSL 0.9.6e uses assertions when detecting buffer overflow attacks instead of less severe mechanisms, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via certain messages that cause OpenSSL to abort from a failed assertion, as demonstrated using SSLv2 CLIENT_MASTER_KEY messages, which are not properly handled in s2_srvr.c.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
