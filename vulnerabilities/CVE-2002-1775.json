Symantec Norton AntiVirus (NAV) 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass the initial virus scan and cause NAV to prematurely stop scanning by using a non-RFC compliant MIME header.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but the AutoProtect feature would detect the virus before it is executed.",
