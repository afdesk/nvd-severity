  "Description": "OpenSSL does not use RSA blinding by default, which allows local and remote attackers to obtain the server's private key by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the number of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of different integer multiplication algorithms (\"Karatsuba\" and normal).",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
