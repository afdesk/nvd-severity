  "Description": "The libCheckSignature function in crypto-utils.lib for OpenCA 0.9.1.6 and earlier only compares the serial of the signer's certificate and the one in the database, which can cause OpenCA to incorrectly accept a signature if the certificate's chain is trusted by OpenCA's chain directory, allowing remote attackers to spoof requests from other users.",
