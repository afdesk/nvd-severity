  "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the search_for_command function of ltrace 0.3.10, if it is installed setuid, could allow local users to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any packages that install ltrace as a setuid program, so this candidate might be REJECTed.",
