  "Description": "The (1) address.html and possibly (2) calendar.html pages in Merak Mail Server 5.2.7 allow remote attackers to gain sensitive information via an invalid HTTP request, which reveals the installation path. NOTE: it is unclear whether the calendar.html is an exposure, since the path is leaked in web logs that may only be available to the administrators, who would have access to the path through legitimate means.",
