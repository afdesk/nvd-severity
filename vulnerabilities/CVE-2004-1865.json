  "Description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the administration panel in bBlog 0.7.2 allows remote authenticated users with superuser privileges to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a blog name ($blogname).  NOTE: if administrators are normally allowed to add HTML by other means, e.g. through Smarty templates, then this issue would not give any additional privileges, and thus would not be considered a vulnerability.",
  "Severity": "LOW"
