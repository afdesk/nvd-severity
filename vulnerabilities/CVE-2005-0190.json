  "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040) and earlier allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via a Real Metadata Packages (RMP) file with a FILENAME tag containing .. (dot dot) sequences in a filename that ends with a ? (question mark) and an allowed file extension (e.g. .mp3), which bypasses the check for the file extension.",
  "Severity": "LOW"
