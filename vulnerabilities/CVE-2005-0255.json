  "Description": "String handling functions in Mozilla 1.7.3, Firefox 1.0, and Thunderbird before 1.0.2, such as the nsTSubstring_CharT::Replace function, do not properly check the return values of other functions that resize the string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code by forcing an out-of-memory state that causes a reallocation to fail and return a pointer to a fixed address, which leads to heap corruption.",
