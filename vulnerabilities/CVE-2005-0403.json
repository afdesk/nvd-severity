  "Description": "init_dev in tty_io.c in the Red Hat backport of NPTL to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 does not properly clear controlling tty's in multi-threaded applications, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly gain tty access via unknown attack vectors that trigger an access of a pointer to a freed structure.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
