  "Description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in myBloggie 2.1.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) year parameter in viewmode.php, or the (2) cat_id, (3) month_no, or (4) post_id parameter in index.php, which are not properly sanitized before they are displayed in an error message.  NOTE: issues 2, 3, and 4 may be due to a problem in associated products rather than myBloggie itself.",
