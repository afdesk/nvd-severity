  "Description": "Format string vulnerability in gedit 2.10.2 may allow attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a bin file with format string specifiers in the filename.  NOTE: while this issue is triggered on the command line by the gedit user, it has been reported that web browsers and email clients could be configured to provide a file name as an argument to gedit, so there is a valid attack that crosses security boundaries.",
  "Severity": "LOW"
