  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.  FileZilla 2.2.14b and 2.2.15, and possibly earlier versions, when \"Use secure mode\" is disabled, uses a weak encryption scheme to store the user's password in the configuration settings file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed the issue, stating that \"the problem is not a vulnerability at all, but in fact a fundamental issue of every single program that can store passwords transparently.\"",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
