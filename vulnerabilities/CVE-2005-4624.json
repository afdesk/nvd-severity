  "Description": "The m_join function in channel.c for PTnet ircd 1.5 and 1.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion that triggers a daemon restart) via a large number of requests to join a \"charmed channel\" such as PTnet, #PTnoticias and #*.log, which causes ircd to open the channel even though it does not have any valid users.",
