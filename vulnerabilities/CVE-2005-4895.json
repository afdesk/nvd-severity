  "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in TCMalloc (tcmalloc.cc) in gperftools before 0.4 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
