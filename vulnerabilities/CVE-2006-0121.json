  "Description": "Multiple memory leaks in IBM Lotus Notes and Domino Server before 6.5.5 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and crash) via unknown vectors related to (1) unspecified vectors during the SSL handshake (SPR# MKIN67MQVW), (2) the stash file during the SSL handshake (SPR# MKIN693QUT), and possibly other vectors. NOTE: due to insufficient information in the original vendor advisory, it is not clear whether there is an attacker role in other memory leaks that are specified in the advisory.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
