  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Directory traversal vulnerability in workspaces.php in phpXplorer 0.9.33 allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) and trailing null byte (%00) in the sShare parameter.  NOTE: a followup post claims that this is not a vulnerability since the functionality of phpXplorer supports the upload of PHP files, which would not cross privilege boundaries since the PHP functionality would support read access outside the web root.",
