  "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in SAP Business Connector (BC) 4.6 and 4.7 allows remote attackers to read or delete arbitrary files via the fullName parameter to (1) sapbc/SAP/chopSAPLog.dsp or (2) invoke/sap.monitor.rfcTrace/deleteSingle.  Details will be updated after the grace period has ended.  NOTE: SAP Business Connector is an OEM version of webMethods Integration Server.  webMethods states that this issue can only occur when the product is installed as root/admin, and if the attacker has access to a general purpose port; however, both are discouraged in the documentation.  In addition, the attacker must already have acquired administrative privileges through other means.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
