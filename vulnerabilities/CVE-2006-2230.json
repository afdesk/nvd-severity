  "Description": "Multiple format string vulnerabilities in xiTK (xitk/main.c) in xine 0.99.4 might allow attackers to cause a denial of service via format string specifiers in an MP3 filename specified on the command line. NOTE: this is a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-1905.  In addition, if the only attack vectors involve a user-assisted, local command line argument of a non-setuid program, this issue might not be a vulnerability.",
