  "Description": "Linux kernel before 2.6.16.21 and 2.6.17, when running on PowerPC, does not perform certain required access_ok checks, which allows local users to read arbitrary kernel memory on 64-bit systems (signal_64.c) and cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly read kernel memory on 32-bit systems (signal_32.c).",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
