  "Description": "Logicalware MailManager before 2.0.10 does not remove 0xc8 0x27 (0xc8 followed by a single-quote character) from the data stream to the server, which allows remote attackers to modify data and gain administrative access when PostgreSQL is used, aka \"bug #1494281 - Postgres encoding security hole.\"  NOTE: while this issue involves PostgreSQL, it is specific to MailManager's interface to PostgreSQL and is therefore a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314.",
