  "Description": "Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using \"..%01\" sequences, which bypass the removal of \"../\" sequences before bytes such as \"%01\" are removed from the filename.  NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274.",
