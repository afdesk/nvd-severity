  "Description": "systeminfo.c for Sun Solaris allows local users to read kernel memory via a 0 variable count argument to the sysinfo system call, which causes a -1 argument to be used by the copyout function.  NOTE: this issue has been referred to as an integer overflow, but it is probably more like a signedness error or integer underflow.",
