  "Description": "The squeue_drain function in Sun Solaris 10, possibly only when run on CMT processors, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (\"bad trap\" and system panic) by opening and closing a large number of TCP connections (\"heavy TCP/IP loads\").  NOTE: the original report specifies the function name as \"drain_squeue,\" but this is likely incorrect.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
