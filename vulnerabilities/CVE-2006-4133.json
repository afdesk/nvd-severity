  "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in SAP Internet Graphics Service (IGS) 6.40 and earlier, and 7.00 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via an HTTP request with an ADM:GETLOGFILE command and a long portwatcher argument, which triggers the overflow during error message construction when the _snprintf function returns a negative value that is used in a memcpy operation.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
