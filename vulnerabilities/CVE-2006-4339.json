  "Description": "OpenSSL before 0.9.7, 0.9.7 before 0.9.7k, and 0.9.8 before 0.9.8c, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, removes PKCS-1 padding before generating a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and prevents OpenSSL from correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS #1.",
