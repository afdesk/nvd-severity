  "Description": "The Panda Platinum Internet Security 2006 10.02.01 and 2007 11.00.00 uses predictable URLs for the spam classification of each message, which allows remote attackers to cause Panda to classify arbitrary messages as spam via a web page that contains IMG tags with the predictable URLs.  NOTE: this issue could also be regarded as a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
