  "Description": "Integer overflow in the ffs_mountfs function in FreeBSD 6.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted UFS filesystem that causes invalid or large size parameters to be provided to the kmem_alloc function. NOTE: a third party states that this issue does not cross privilege boundaries in FreeBSD because only root may mount a filesystem.",
