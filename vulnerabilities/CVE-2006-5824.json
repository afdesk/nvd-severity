  "Description": "Integer overflow in the ffs_rdextattr function in FreeBSD 6.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) and trigger a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted UFS filesystem, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-5679.  NOTE: a third party states that this issue does not cross privilege boundaries in FreeBSD because only root may mount a filesystem.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
