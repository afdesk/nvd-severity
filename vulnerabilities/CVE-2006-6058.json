  "Description": "The minix filesystem code in Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.24, including 2.6.18, allows local users to cause a denial of service (hang) via a malformed minix file stream that triggers an infinite loop in the minix_bmap function.  NOTE: this issue might be due to an integer overflow or signedness error.",
