  "Description": "Enigmail 0.94.2 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when invoking GnuPG, which prevents Enigmail from visually distinguishing between signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a message without detection.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
