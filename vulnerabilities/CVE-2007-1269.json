  "Description": "GNUMail 1.1.2 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when invoking GnuPG, which prevents GNUMail from visually distinguishing between signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a message without detection.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
