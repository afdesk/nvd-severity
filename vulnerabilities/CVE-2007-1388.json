  "Description": "The do_ipv6_setsockopt function in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in Linux kernel before 2.6.20, and possibly other versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (oops) by calling setsockopt with the IPV6_RTHDR option name and possibly a zero option length or invalid option value, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.",
