  "Description": "The LLTD Mapper in Microsoft Windows Vista does not verify that an IP address in a TLV type 0x07 field in a HELLO packet corresponds to a valid IP address for the local network, which allows remote attackers to trick users into communicating with an external host by sending a HELLO packet with the MW characteristic and a spoofed TLV type 0x07 field, aka the \"Spoof and Management URL IP Redirect\" attack.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
