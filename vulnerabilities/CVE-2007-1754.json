  "Description": "PUBCONV.DLL in Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 does not properly clear memory when transferring data from disk to memory, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed .pub page via a certain negative value, which bypasses a sanitization procedure that initializes critical pointers to NULL, aka the \"Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability\".",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
