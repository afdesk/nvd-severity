  "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component in Oracle Database 9.0.1.5, 9.2.0.8, 10.1.0.5, and 10.2.0.2 on Windows allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact, aka DB01.  NOTE: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that this issue occurs because the NTLM SSPI AcceptSecurityContext function grants privileges based on the username provided even though all users are authenticated as Guest, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
