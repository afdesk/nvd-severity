  "Description": "The random number feature in Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.20.13, and 2.6.21.x before 2.6.21.4, (1) does not properly seed pools when there is no entropy, or (2) uses an incorrect cast when extracting entropy, which might cause the random number generator to provide the same values after reboots on systems without an entropy source.",
