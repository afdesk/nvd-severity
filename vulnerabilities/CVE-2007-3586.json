  "Description": "Multiple direct static code injection vulnerabilities in MyCMS 0.9.8 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into (1) a _score.txt file via the score parameter, or (2) a _setby.txt file via a login cookie, which is then included by games.php.  NOTE: programs that use games.php might include (a) snakep.php, (b) tetrisp.php, and possibly other site-specific files.",
