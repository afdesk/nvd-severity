  "Description": "archive_read_support_format_tar.c in libarchive before 2.2.4 does not properly compute the length of a certain buffer when processing a malformed pax extension header, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) PAX or (2) TAR archive that triggers a buffer overflow.",
