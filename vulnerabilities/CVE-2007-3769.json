  "Description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the mirrored server management interface in SurgeFTP 2.3a1 allows user-assisted, remote FTP servers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a malformed response without a status code, which is reflected to the user in the resulting error message.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for root access via a sequence of steps involving web script that creates a new FTP user account.",
