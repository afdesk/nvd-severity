  "Description": "Off-by-one error in the QUtf8Decoder::toUnicode function in Trolltech Qt 3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted Unicode string that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. NOTE: Qt 4 has the same error in the QUtf8Codec::convertToUnicode function, but it is not exploitable.",
