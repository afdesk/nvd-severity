  "Description": "The server in Toribash 2.71 and earlier does not properly handle long commands, which allows remote attackers to trigger a protocol violation in which data is sent to other clients without a required LF character, as demonstrated by a SAY command.  NOTE: the security impact of this violation is not clear, although it probably makes exploitation of CVE-2007-4449 easier.",
