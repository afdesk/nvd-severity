  "Description": "Unreal Commander 0.92 build 565 and 573 writes portions of heap memory into local files when extracting from an archive with malformed size information in a file header, which might allow user-assisted attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) by reading the extracted files.  NOTE: this issue is only a vulnerability if Unreal is run with privileges, or if the extracted files are made accessible to other users.",
