  "Description": "The nvcoaft51 driver in Norman Virus Control (NVC) 5.82 uses weak permissions (unrestricted write access) for the NvcOa device, which allows local users to gain privileges by (1) triggering a buffer overflow in a kernel pool via a string argument to ioctl 0xBF67201C; or by (2) sending a crafted KEVENT structure through ioctl 0xBF672028 to overwrite arbitrary memory locations.",
