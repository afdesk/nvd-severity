  "Description": "Dibbler 0.6.0 does not verify that certain length parameters are appropriate for buffer sizes, which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and cause a denial of service (daemon crash), as demonstrated by incorrect behavior of the TSrvMsg constructor in SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp when (1) reading the option code and option length and (2) parsing options.",
