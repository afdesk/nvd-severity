  "Description": "The disconnect method in the Philips USB Webcam (pwc) driver in Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.22.6 \"relies on user space to close the device,\" which allows user-assisted local attackers to cause a denial of service (USB subsystem hang and CPU consumption in khubd) by not closing the device after the disconnect is invoked.  NOTE: this rarely crosses privilege boundaries, unless the attacker can convince the victim to unplug the affected device.",
