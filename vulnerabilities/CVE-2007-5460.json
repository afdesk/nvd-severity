  "Description": "Microsoft ActiveSync 4.1, as used in Windows Mobile 5.0, uses weak encryption (XOR obfuscation with a fixed key) when sending the user's PIN/Password over the USB connection from the host to the device, which might make it easier for attackers to decode a PIN/Password obtained by (1) sniffing or (2) spoofing the docking process.",
