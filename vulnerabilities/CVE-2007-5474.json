  "Description": "The driver for the Linksys WRT350N Wi-Fi access point with firmware 2.00.17 on the Atheros AR5416-AC1E chipset does not properly parse the Atheros vendor-specific information element in an association request, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (device reboot or hang) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an Atheros information element with an invalid length, as demonstrated by an element that is too long.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
