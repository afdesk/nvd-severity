  "Description": "slapo-pcache (overlays/pcache.c) in slapd in OpenLDAP before 2.3.39, when running as a proxy-caching server, allocates memory using a malloc variant instead of calloc, which prevents an array from being initialized properly and might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via unknown vectors that prevent the array from being null terminated.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
