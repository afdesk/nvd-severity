  "Description": "The hack-local-variables function in Emacs before 22.2, when enable-local-variables is set to :safe, does not properly search lists of unsafe or risky variables, which might allow user-assisted attackers to bypass intended restrictions and modify critical program variables via a file containing a Local variables declaration.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
