  "Description": "Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Armin Burger p.mapper 3.2.0 beta3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the _SESSION[PM_INCPHP] parameter to (1) incphp/globals.php or (2) plugins/export/mc_table.php.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is caused by a problem in PHP and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in p.mapper.",
