  "Description": "The nfs_lock function in fs/nfs/file.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.9 does not properly remove POSIX locks on files that are setgid without group-execute permission, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash) by locking a file on an NFS filesystem and then changing this file's permissions, a related issue to CVE-2010-0727.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
