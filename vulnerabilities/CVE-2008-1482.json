  "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in xine-lib 1.1.11 and earlier allow remote attackers to trigger heap-based buffer overflows and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted .FLV file, which triggers an overflow in demuxers/demux_flv.c; (2) a crafted .MOV file, which triggers an overflow in demuxers/demux_qt.c; (3) a crafted .RM file, which triggers an overflow in demuxers/demux_real.c; (4) a crafted .MVE file, which triggers an overflow in demuxers/demux_wc3movie.c; (5) a crafted .MKV file, which triggers an overflow in demuxers/ebml.c; or (6) a crafted .CAK file, which triggers an overflow in demuxers/demux_film.c.",
