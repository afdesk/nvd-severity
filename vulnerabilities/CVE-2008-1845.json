  "Description": "The Korn shell (aka mksh) before R33d on MirOS (aka MirBSD) does not flush the tty's I/O when invoking mksh in a new terminal, which allows local users to gain privileges by opening a virtual terminal and entering command sequences, which might later be executed in opportunistic circumstances by a different user who launches mksh and specifies that terminal with the -T option.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
