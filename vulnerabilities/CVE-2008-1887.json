  "Description": "Python 2.5.2 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via multiple vectors that cause a negative size value to be provided to the PyString_FromStringAndSize function, which allocates less memory than expected when assert() is disabled and triggers a buffer overflow.",
