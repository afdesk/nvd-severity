  "Description": "The Microsoft Office Snapshot Viewer ActiveX control in snapview.ocx 10.0.5529.0, as distributed in the standalone Snapshot Viewer and Microsoft Office Access 2000 through 2003, allows remote attackers to download arbitrary files to a client machine via a crafted HTML document or e-mail message, probably involving use of the SnapshotPath and CompressedPath properties and the PrintSnapshot method. NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.",
