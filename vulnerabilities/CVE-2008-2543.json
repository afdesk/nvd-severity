  "Description": "The ooh323 channel driver in Asterisk Addons 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and Asterisk-Addons 1.4.x before 1.4.7 creates a remotely accessible TCP port that is intended solely for localhost communication, and interprets some TCP application-data fields as addresses of memory to free, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via crafted TCP packets.",
