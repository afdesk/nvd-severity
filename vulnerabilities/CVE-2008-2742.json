  "Description": "Unrestricted file upload in the mcpuk file editor (atk/attributes/fck/editor/filemanager/browser/mcpuk/connectors/php/config.php) in Achievo 1.2.0 through 1.3.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with .php followed by a safe extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in the Achievo root directory.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability in environments that support multiple extensions, such as Apache with the mod_mime module enabled.",
