  "Description": "Integer overflow in the IopfCompleteRequest API in the kernel in Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, and Vista allows context-dependent attackers to gain privileges. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for GEARAspiWDM.sys 2.0.7.5 in Gear Software CD DVD Filter driver before 4.001.7, as used in other products including Apple iTunes and multiple Symantec and Norton products, which allows local users to gain privileges via repeated IoAttachDevice IOCTL calls to \\\\.\\GEARAspiWDMDevice in this GEARAspiWDM.sys.  However, the root cause is the integer overflow in the API call itself.",
