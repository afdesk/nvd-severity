  "Description": "The i915 driver in (1) drivers/char/drm/i915_dma.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.24 on Debian GNU/Linux and (2) sys/dev/pci/drm/i915_drv.c in OpenBSD does not restrict the DRM_I915_HWS_ADDR ioctl to the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) master, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted ioctl call, related to absence of the DRM_MASTER and DRM_ROOT_ONLY flags in the ioctl's configuration.",
