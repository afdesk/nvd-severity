  "Description": "lib/viewvc.py in ViewVC 1.0.5 uses the content-type parameter in the HTTP request for the Content-Type header in the HTTP response, which allows remote attackers to cause content to be misinterpreted by the browser via a content-type parameter that is inconsistent with the requested object.  NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since it requires attacker access to the repository that is being viewed.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
