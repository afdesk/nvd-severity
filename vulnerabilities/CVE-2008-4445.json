  "Description": "The sctp_auth_ep_set_hmacs function in net/sctp/auth.c in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (sctp) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.26.4, when the SCTP-AUTH extension is enabled, does not verify that the identifier index is within the bounds established by SCTP_AUTH_HMAC_ID_MAX, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via a crafted SCTP_HMAC_IDENT IOCTL request involving the sctp_getsockopt function, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-4113.",
