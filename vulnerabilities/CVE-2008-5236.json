  "Description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to (1) a crafted EBML element length processed by the parse_block_group function in demux_matroska.c; (2) a certain combination of sps, w, and h values processed by the real_parse_audio_specific_data and demux_real_send_chunk functions in demux_real.c; and (3) an unspecified combination of three values processed by the open_ra_file function in demux_realaudio.c.  NOTE: vector 2 reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix in 1.1.15.",
