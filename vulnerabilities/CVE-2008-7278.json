  "Description": "The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.2.5, and 2.3.x before 2.3.0-beta1, does not properly configure the RANDFILE environment variable for OpenSSL, which might make it easier for remote attackers to decrypt e-mail messages that had lower than intended entropy available for cryptographic operations, related to inability to write to the seeding file.",
