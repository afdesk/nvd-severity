  "Description": "Tor 0.2.0.28, and probably 0.2.0.34 and earlier, allows remote attackers, with control of an entry router and an exit router, to confirm that a sender and receiver are communicating via vectors involving (1) replaying, (2) modifying, (3) inserting, or (4) deleting a single cell, and then observing cell recognition errors at the exit router.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, noting that the product's design \"accepted end-to-end correlation as an attack that is too expensive to solve.\"",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
