  "Description": "Integer overflow in the CSoundFile::ReadMed function (src/load_med.cpp) in libmodplug before 0.8.6, as used in gstreamer-plugins, TTPlayer, and other products, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MED file with a crafted (1) song comment or (2) song name, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild in August 2008.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
