  "Description": "ajaxterm.js in AjaxTerm 0.10 and earlier generates session IDs with predictable random numbers based on certain JavaScript functions, which makes it easier for remote attackers to (1) hijack a session or (2) cause a denial of service (session ID exhaustion) via a brute-force attack.",
