  "Description": "libpng before 1.2.37 does not properly parse 1-bit interlaced images with width values that are not divisible by 8, which causes libpng to include uninitialized bits in certain rows of a PNG file and might allow remote attackers to read portions of sensitive memory via \"out-of-bounds pixels\" in the file.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
