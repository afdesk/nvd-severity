  "Description": "Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.12.3, Firefox before 3.0.13, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.23, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.18 do not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority. NOTE: this was originally reported for Firefox before 3.5.",
