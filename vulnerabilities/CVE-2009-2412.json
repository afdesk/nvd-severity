  "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library and the Apache Portable Utility library (aka APR-util) 0.9.x and 1.3.x allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors that trigger crafted calls to the (1) allocator_alloc or (2) apr_palloc function in memory/unix/apr_pools.c in APR; or crafted calls to the (3) apr_rmm_malloc, (4) apr_rmm_calloc, or (5) apr_rmm_realloc function in misc/apr_rmm.c in APR-util; leading to buffer overflows. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
