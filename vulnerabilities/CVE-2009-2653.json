  "Description": "** DISPUTED **  The NtUserConsoleControl function in win32k.sys in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 before SP1, allows local administrators to bypass unspecified \"security software\" and gain privileges via a crafted call that triggers an overwrite of an arbitrary memory location.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that 'the Administrator to SYSTEM \"escalation\" is not a security boundary we defend.'",
