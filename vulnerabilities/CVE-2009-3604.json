  "Description": "The Splash::drawImage function in Splash.cc in Xpdf 2.x and 3.x before 3.02pl4, and Poppler 0.x, as used in GPdf and kdegraphics KPDF, does not properly allocate memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF document that triggers a NULL pointer dereference or a heap-based buffer overflow.",
