  "Description": "The mod_tls module in ProFTPD before 1.3.2b, and 1.3.3 before 1.3.3rc2, when the dNSNameRequired TLS option is enabled, does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 client certificate, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended client-hostname restrictions via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.",
