  "Description": "The default configuration of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance (Cisco ASA) 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 allows portal traffic to access arbitrary backend servers, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and access unauthorized web sites via a crafted URL obfuscated with ROT13 and a certain encoding.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported as a vulnerability related to lack of restrictions to URLs listed in the Cisco WebVPN bookmark component, but the vendor states that \"The bookmark feature is not a security feature.\"",
