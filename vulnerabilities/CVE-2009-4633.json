  "Description": "vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 uses an assignment operator when a comparison operator was intended, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted file that modifies a loop counter and triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
