  "Description": "FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with improperly ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use inconsistent codec types and identifiers, leading to processing of a video-structure pointer by the mp3 decoder, and a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
