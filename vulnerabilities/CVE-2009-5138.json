  "Description": "GnuTLS before 2.7.6, when the GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT flag is not enabled, treats version 1 X.509 certificates as intermediate CAs, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions by leveraging a X.509 V1 certificate from a trusted CA to issue new certificates, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-1959.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
