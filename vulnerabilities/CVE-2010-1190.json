  "Description": "thumb.php in MediaWiki before 1.15.2, when used with access-restriction mechanisms such as img_auth.php, does not check user permissions before providing scaled images, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read private images via unspecified manipulations.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
