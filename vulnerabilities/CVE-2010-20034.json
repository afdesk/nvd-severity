  "Description": "Gekko Manager FTP Client <= 0.77 contains a stack-based buffer overflow in its FTP directory listing parser. When processing a server response to a LIST command, the client fails to properly validate the length of filenames. A crafted response containing an overly long filename can overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH), potentially allowing remote code execution.",
