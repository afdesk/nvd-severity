  "Description": "FTPPad <= 1.2.0 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its FTP directory listing parser. When the client connects to an FTP server and receives a crafted response to a LIST command containing an excessively long directory and filename, the application fails to properly validate input length. This results in a buffer overflow that overwrites the saved Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP), allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.",
