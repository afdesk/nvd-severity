  "Description": "The DNS resolution functionality in the CIFS implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35, when CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL is enabled, relies on a user's keyring for the dns_resolver upcall in the cifs.upcall userspace helper, which allows local users to spoof the results of DNS queries and perform arbitrary CIFS mounts via vectors involving an add_key call, related to a \"cache stuffing\" issue and MS-DFS referrals.",
