  "Description": "The TIFFVStripSize function in tif_strip.c in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2 makes incorrect calls to the TIFFGetField function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted TIFF image, related to \"downsampled OJPEG input\" and possibly related to a compiler optimization that triggers a divide-by-zero error.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
