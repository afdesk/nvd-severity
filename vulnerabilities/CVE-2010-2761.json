  "Description": "The multipart_init function in (1) CGI.pm before 3.50 and (2) Simple.pm in CGI::Simple 1.112 and earlier uses a hardcoded value of the MIME boundary string in multipart/x-mixed-replace content, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via crafted input that contains this value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-3172.",
