  "Description": "Apache Traffic Server before 2.0.1, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2-unstable, does not properly choose DNS source ports and transaction IDs, and does not properly use DNS query fields to validate responses, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to poison the internal DNS cache via a crafted response.",
