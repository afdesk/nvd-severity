  "Description": "The js_InitRandom function in the JavaScript implementation in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.10 through 3.5.11, 3.6.4 through 3.6.8, and 4.0 Beta1 uses a context pointer in conjunction with its successor pointer for seeding of a random number generator, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the seed value via a brute-force attack, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-3171.",
