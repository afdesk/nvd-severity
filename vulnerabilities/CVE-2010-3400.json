  "Description": "The js_InitRandom function in the JavaScript implementation in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x before 3.5.10 and 3.6.x before 3.6.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.5, uses the current time for seeding of a random number generator, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the seed value via a brute-force attack, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5913.",
