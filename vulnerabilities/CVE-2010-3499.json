  "Description": "F-Secure Anti-Virus does not properly interact with the processing of hcp:// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support Center, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malware that is correctly detected by this product, but with a detection approach that occurs too late to stop the code execution.  NOTE: the researcher indicates that a vendor response was received, stating that \"the inability to catch these files are caused by lacking functionality rather than programming errors.\"",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
