NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that the Kerberos implementation does not properly check AP-REQ requests, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service in the JVM.  NOTE: CVE has not investigated the apparent discrepancy between the two vendors regarding the consequences of this issue.",
