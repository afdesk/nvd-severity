  "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, and 5.0 Update 25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that this is related to a calculation error in right-to-left text character counts for the ICU OpenType font rendering implementation, which triggers an out-of-bounds memory access.",
