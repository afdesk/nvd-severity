  "Description": "The GTK version of ettercap uses a global settings file at /tmp/.ettercap_gtk and does not verify ownership of this file. When parsing this file for settings in gtkui_conf_read() (src/interfacesgtk/ec_gtk_conf.c), an unchecked sscanf() call allows a maliciously placed settings file to overflow a statically-sized buffer on the stack.",
