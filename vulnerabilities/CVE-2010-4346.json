  "Description": "The install_special_mapping function in mm/mmap.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37-rc6 does not make an expected security_file_mmap function call, which allows local users to bypass intended mmap_min_addr restrictions and possibly conduct NULL pointer dereference attacks via a crafted assembly-language application.",
