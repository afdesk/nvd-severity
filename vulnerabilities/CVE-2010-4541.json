  "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long \"Number of lights\" field in a plugin configuration file. NOTE: it may be uncommon to obtain a GIMP plugin configuration file from an untrusted source that is separate from the distribution of the plugin itself.",
