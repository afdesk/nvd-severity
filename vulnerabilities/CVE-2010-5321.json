  "Description": "Memory leak in drivers/media/video/videobuf-core.c in the videobuf subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x through 4.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by leveraging /dev/video access for a series of mmap calls that require new allocations, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-6761.  NOTE: as of 2016-06-18, this affects only 11 drivers that have not been updated to use videobuf2 instead of videobuf.",
