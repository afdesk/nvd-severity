  "Description": "The _list_file_get function in lib/Majordomo.pm in Majordomo 2 20110203 and earlier allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and read arbitrary files via a ./.../ sequence in the \"extra\" parameter to the help command, which causes the regular expression to produce .. (dot dot) sequences.  NOTE: this vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-0049.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
