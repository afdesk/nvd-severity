  "Description": "The VpMemAlloc function in bigdecimal.c in the BigDecimal class in Ruby 1.9.2-p136 and earlier, as used on Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.7 and other platforms, does not properly allocate memory, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via vectors involving creation of a large BigDecimal value within a 64-bit process, related to an \"integer truncation issue.\"",
