  "Description": "The RealNetworks RealArcade platform includes an ActiveX control (InstallerDlg.dll, version 2.6.0.445) that exposes a method named Exec via the StubbyUtil.ProcessMgr COM object. This method allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a victim's Windows machine without proper validation or restrictions. This platform was sometimes referred to or otherwise known as RealArcade or Arcade Games and has since consolidated with RealNetworks' platform, GameHouse.",
