  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to\u00a02011R1.9\u00a0contain privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the scripts that install or update system crontab entries. Due to time-of-check/time-of-use\u00a0race conditions and missing synchronization or final-path validation, a local low-privileged user could manipulate filesystem state during crontab installation to influence the files or commands executed with elevated privileges, resulting in execution with higher privileges.",
