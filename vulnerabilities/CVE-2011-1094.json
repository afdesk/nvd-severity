  "Description": "kio/kio/tcpslavebase.cpp in KDE KSSL in kdelibs before 4.6.1 does not properly verify that the server hostname matches the domain name of the subject of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority for an IP address, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2702.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
