  "Description": "Multiple format string vulnerabilities in phar_object.c in the phar extension in PHP 5.3.5 and earlier allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in an argument to a class method, leading to an incorrect zend_throw_exception_ex call.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
