  "Description": "The STARTTLS implementation in the server in Ipswitch IMail 11.03 and earlier does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a \"plaintext command injection\" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
