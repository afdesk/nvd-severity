  "Description": "drivers/scsi/mpt2sas/mpt2sas_ctl.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.38 and earlier does not validate (1) length and (2) offset values before performing memory copy operations, which might allow local users to gain privileges, cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call, related to the _ctl_do_mpt_command and _ctl_diag_read_buffer functions.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
