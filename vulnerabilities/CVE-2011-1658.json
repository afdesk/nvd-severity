  "Description": "ld.so in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.13 and earlier expands the $ORIGIN dynamic string token when RPATH is composed entirely of this token, which might allow local users to gain privileges by creating a hard link in an arbitrary directory to a (1) setuid or (2) setgid program with this RPATH value, and then executing the program with a crafted value for the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-3847 and CVE-2011-0536.  NOTE: it is not expected that any standard operating-system distribution would ship an applicable setuid or setgid program.",
  "Severity": "LOW"
