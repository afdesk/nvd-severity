  "Description": "The makemask function in mountd.c in mountd in FreeBSD 7.4 through 8.2 does not properly handle a -network field specifying a CIDR block with a prefix length that is not an integer multiple of 8, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances via an NFS mount request.",
