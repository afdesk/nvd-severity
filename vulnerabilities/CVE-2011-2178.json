  "Description": "The virSecurityManagerGetPrivateData function in security/security_manager.c in libvirt 0.8.8 through 0.9.1 uses the wrong argument for a sizeof call, which causes incorrect processing of \"security manager private data\" that \"reopens disk probing\" and might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2010-2238 regression.",
