  "Description": "The ldm_frag_add function in fs/partitions/ldm.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39.1 does not properly handle memory allocation for non-initial fragments, which might allow local users to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and gain privileges or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted LDM partition table. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1017.",
