  "Description": "The virtio_queue_notify in qemu-kvm 0.14.0 and earlier does not properly validate the virtqueue number, which allows guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative number in the Queue Notify field of the Virtio Header, which bypasses a signed comparison.",
