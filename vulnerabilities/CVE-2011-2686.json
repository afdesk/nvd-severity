  "Description": "Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900. NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
