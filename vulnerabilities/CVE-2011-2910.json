  "Description": "The AX.25 daemon (ax25d) in ax25-tools before 0.0.8-13 does not check the return value of a setuid call. The setuid call is responsible for dropping privileges but if the call fails the daemon would continue to run with root privileges which can allow possible privilege escalation.",
