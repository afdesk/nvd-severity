  "Description": "Yubico PAM Module before 2.10 performed user authentication when 'use_first_pass' PAM configuration option was not used and the module was configured as 'sufficient' in the PAM configuration. A remote attacker could use this flaw to circumvent common authentication process and obtain access to the account in question by providing a NULL value (pressing Ctrl-D keyboard sequence) as the password string.",
