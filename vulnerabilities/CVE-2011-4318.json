  "Description": "Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.",
