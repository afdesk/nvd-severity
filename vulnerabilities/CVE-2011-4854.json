  "Description": "The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.4.4_build20111103.18 does not ensure that Content-Type HTTP headers match the corresponding Content-Type data in HTML META elements, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving the get_enabled_product_icon program.
