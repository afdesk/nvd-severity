  "Description": "The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.4.4_build20111103.18 omits the Content-Type header's charset parameter for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving admin/customer-service-plan/list/reset-search/true/ and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be affected by this issue.",
