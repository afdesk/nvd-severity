  "Description": "Xen 3.4, 4.0, and 4.1, when the guest OS has not registered a handler for a syscall or sysenter instruction, does not properly clear a flag for exception injection when injecting a General Protection Fault, which allows local PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) by later triggering an exception that would normally be handled within Xen.",
  "Severity": "LOW"
