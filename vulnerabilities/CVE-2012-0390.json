  "Description": "The DTLS implementation in GnuTLS 3.0.10 and earlier executes certain error-handling code only if there is a specific relationship between a padding length and the ciphertext size, which makes it easier for remote attackers to recover partial plaintext via a timing side-channel attack, a related issue to CVE-2011-4108.",
