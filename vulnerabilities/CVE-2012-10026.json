The endpoint fails to properly validate and restrict uploaded file types, allowing remote attackers to upload malicious PHP scripts to a predictable temporary directory. Once uploaded, the attacker can execute the file via a direct HTTP GET request, resulting in remote code execution under the web server\u2019s context.",
