  "Description": "BlazeVideo HDTV Player Pro v6.6.0.3 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of user-supplied input embedded in .plf playlist files. When parsing a crafted .plf file, the MediaPlayerCtrl.dll component invokes PathFindFileNameA() to extract a filename from a URL-like string. The returned value is then copied to a fixed-size stack buffer using an inline strcpy call without bounds checking. If the input exceeds the buffer size, this leads to a stack overflow and potential arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",
