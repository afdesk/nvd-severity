  "Description": "MobileCartly version 1.0 contains an arbitrary file creation vulnerability in the savepage.php script. The application fails to perform authentication or authorization checks before invoking file_put_contents() on attacker-controlled input. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to savepage.php, specifying both the filename and content. This allows arbitrary file creation within the pages/ directory or any writable path on the server, allowing remote code execution.",
