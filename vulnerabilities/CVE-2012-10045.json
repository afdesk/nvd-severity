  "Description": "XODA version 0.4.5 contains an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The flaw resides in the upload functionality, which fails to properly validate or restrict uploaded file types. By crafting a multipart/form-data POST request, an attacker can upload a .php file directly into the web-accessible files/ directory and trigger its execution via a subsequent GET request.",
