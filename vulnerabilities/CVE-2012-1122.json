  "Description": "bug_actiongroup.php in MantisBT before 1.2.9 does not properly check the report_bug_threshold permission of the receiving project when moving a bug report, which allows remote authenticated users with the report_bug_threshold and move_bug_threshold privileges for a project to bypass intended access restrictions and move bug reports to a different project.",
  "Severity": "LOW"
