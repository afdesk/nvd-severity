  "Description": "fcgid_spawn_ctl.c in the mod_fcgid module 2.3.6 for the Apache HTTP Server does not recognize the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive for a virtual host, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of HTTP requests that triggers a process count higher than the intended limit.",
