  "Description": "The ELF file parser in Fortinet Antivirus 4.2.254.0, eSafe 7.0.17.0, Dr.Web 5.0.2.03300, and Panda Antivirus 10.0.2.7 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via an ELF file with a modified e_version field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different ELF parser implementations.",
