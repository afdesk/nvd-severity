  "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 through Update 11 and 6 through Update 38 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Deployment, a different vulnerability than other CVEs listed in the February 2013 CPU.  NOTE: the previous information is from the February 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a third party that the issue is due to an interaction error in between the JRE plug-in for WebKit-based browsers and the Javascript engine, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by modifying DOM nodes that contain applet elements in a way that triggers an incorrect reference count and a use after free.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
