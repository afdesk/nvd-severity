  "Description": "Integer signedness error in the TIFFReadDirectory function in tif_dirread.c in libtiff 3.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative tile depth in a tiff image, which triggers an improper conversion between signed and unsigned types, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
