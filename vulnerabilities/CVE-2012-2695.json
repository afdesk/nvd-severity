  "Description": "The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.14, 3.1.x before 3.1.6, and 3.2.x before 3.2.6 does not properly implement the passing of request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage improper handling of nested hashes, a related issue to CVE-2012-2661.",
