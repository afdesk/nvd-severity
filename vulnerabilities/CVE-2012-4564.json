  "Description": "ppm2tiff does not check the return value of the TIFFScanlineSize function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PPM image that triggers an integer overflow, a zero-memory allocation, and a heap-based buffer overflow.",
