  "Description": "The tor_timegm function in common/util.c in Tor before 0.2.2.39, and 0.2.3.x before 0.2.3.22-rc, does not properly validate time values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed directory object, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4419.",
