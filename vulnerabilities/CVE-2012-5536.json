  "Description": "A certain Red Hat build of the pam_ssh_agent_auth module on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and Fedora Rawhide calls the glibc error function instead of the error function in the OpenSSH codebase, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from process memory or possibly gain privileges via crafted use of an application that relies on this module, as demonstrated by su and sudo.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
