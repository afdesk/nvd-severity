  "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in freeFTPd version 1.0.10 and earlier in the handling of the FTP PASS command. When an attacker sends a specially crafted password string, the application fails to validate input length, resulting in memory corruption. This can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Exploitation requires the anonymous user account to be enabled.",
