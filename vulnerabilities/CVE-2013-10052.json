  "Description": "ZPanel includes a helper binary named zsudo, intended to allow restricted privilege escalation for administrative tasks. However, when misconfigured in /etc/sudoers, zsudo can be invoked by low-privileged users\u00a0to execute arbitrary commands as root. This flaw enables local attackers with shell access to escalate privileges by writing a payload to a writable directory and executing it via zsudo. The vulnerability is particularly impactful in post-exploitation scenarios following web server compromise, where the attacker inherits access to zsudo.",
