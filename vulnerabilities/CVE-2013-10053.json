  "Description": "A remote command execution vulnerability exists in ZPanel version 10.0.0.2 in its htpasswd module. When creating .htaccess files, the inHTUsername field is passed unsanitized to a system() call that invokes the system\u2019s htpasswd binary. By injecting shell metacharacters into the username field, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary system commands. Exploitation requires a valid ZPanel account\u2014such as one in the default Users, Resellers, or Administrators groups\u2014but no elevated privileges.",
