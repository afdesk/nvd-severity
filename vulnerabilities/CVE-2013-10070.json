  "Description": "PHP-Charts v1.0 contains a PHP code execution vulnerability in wizard/url.php, where user-supplied GET parameter names are passed directly to eval() without sanitization. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a request that injects arbitrary PHP code, resulting in command execution under the web server's context. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute system-level commands via base64-encoded payloads embedded in parameter names, leading to full compromise of the host system.",
