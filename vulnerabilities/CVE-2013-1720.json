  "Description": "The nsHtml5TreeBuilder::resetTheInsertionMode function in the HTML5 Tree Builder in Mozilla Firefox before 24.0, Thunderbird before 24.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.21 does not properly maintain the state of the insertion-mode stack for template elements, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read) by triggering use of this stack in its empty state.",
