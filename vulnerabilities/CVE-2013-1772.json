  "Description": "The log_prefix function in kernel/printk.c in the Linux kernel 3.x before 3.4.33 does not properly remove a prefix string from a syslog header, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and system crash) by leveraging /dev/kmsg write access and triggering a call_console_drivers function call.",
