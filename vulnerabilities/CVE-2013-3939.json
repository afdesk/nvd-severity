  "Description": "xnview.exe in XnView before 2.13 does not properly handle RLE strip lengths during processing of RGB files, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the RLE strip size field in a RGB file, which leads to an unexpected sign extension error and a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
