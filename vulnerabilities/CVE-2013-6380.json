  "Description": "The aac_send_raw_srb function in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12.1 does not properly validate a certain size value, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an FSACTL_SEND_RAW_SRB ioctl call that triggers a crafted SRB command.",
