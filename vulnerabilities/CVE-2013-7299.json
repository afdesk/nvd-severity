  "Description": "framework/common/messageheaderparser.cpp in Tntnet before 2.2.1 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a header that ends in \\n instead of \\r\\n, which prevents a null terminator from being added and causes Tntnet to include headers from other requests.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
