  "Description": "The do_ssl3_write function in s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 1.x through 1.0.1g, when SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, does not properly manage a buffer pointer during certain recursive calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via vectors that trigger an alert condition.",
