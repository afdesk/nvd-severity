  "Description": "An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Kloxo web hosting control panel (developed by LXCenter) prior to version 6.1.12. The flaw resides in the login-name parameter passed to lbin/webcommand.php, which fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to extract the administrator\u2019s password from the backend database. After recovering valid credentials, the attacker can authenticate to the Kloxo control panel and leverage the Command Center feature (display.php) to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on the underlying host system. This vulnerability was reported to be exploited in the wild in January 2014.",
