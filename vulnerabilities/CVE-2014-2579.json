  "Description": "Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in XCloner Standalone 3.5 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change the administrator password via the config task to index2.php or (2) when the enable_db_backup and sql_mem options are enabled, access the database backup functionality via the dbbackup_comp parameter in the generate action to index2.php.  NOTE: vector 2 might be a duplicate of CVE-2014-2340, which is for the XCloner Wordpress plugin.  NOTE: remote attackers can leverage CVE-2014-2996 with vector 2 to execute arbitrary commands.",
