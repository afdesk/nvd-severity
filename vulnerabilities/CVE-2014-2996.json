  "Description": "XCloner Standalone 3.5 and earlier, when enable_db_backup and sql_mem are enabled, allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the dbbackup_comp parameter in a generate action to index2.php.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries, since administrators might already have the privileges to execute code.
