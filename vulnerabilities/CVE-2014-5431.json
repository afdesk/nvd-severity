  "Description": "Baxter SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System version 6.05 (model 35700BAX) with wireless battery module (WBM) version 16 contains a hard-coded password, which provides access to basic biomedical information, limited device settings, and network configuration of the WBM, if connected. The hard-coded password may allow an attacker with physical access to the device to access management functions to make unauthorized configuration changes to biomedical settings such as turn on and off wireless connections and the phase-complete audible alarm that indicates the end of an infusion phase. Baxter has released a new version of the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System, version 8, which incorporates hardware and software changes.",
