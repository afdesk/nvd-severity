  "Description": "The snd_compress_check_input function in sound/core/compress_offload.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.17 does not properly check for an integer overflow, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (insufficient memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SNDRV_COMPRESS_SET_PARAMS ioctl call.",
