  "Description": "The DecodeHSTSPreloadRaw function in net/http/transport_security_state.cc in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.130 does not properly canonicalize DNS hostnames before making comparisons to HSTS or HPKP preload entries, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a string that (1) ends in a . (dot) character or (2) is not entirely lowercase.",
