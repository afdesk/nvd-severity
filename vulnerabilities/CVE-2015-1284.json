  "Description": "The LocalFrame::isURLAllowed function in core/frame/LocalFrame.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, does not properly check for a page's maximum number of frames, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid count value and use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that makes many createElement calls for IFRAME elements.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
