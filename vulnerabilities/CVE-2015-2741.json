  "Description": "Mozilla Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.1, and Thunderbird before 38.1 do not enforce key pinning upon encountering an X.509 certificate problem that generates a user dialog, which allows user-assisted man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by triggering a (1) expired certificate or (2) mismatched hostname for a domain with pinning enabled.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
