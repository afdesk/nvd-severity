  "Description": "drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the OZWPAN driver in the Linux kernel through 4.0.5 does not ensure that certain length values are sufficiently large, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash or large loop) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet, related to the (1) oz_usb_rx and (2) oz_usb_handle_ep_data functions.",
