  "Description": "In Docker Notary before 0.1, gotuf/signed/verify.go has a Signature Algorithm Not Matched to Key vulnerability. Because an attacker controls the field specifying the signature algorithm, they might (for example) be able to forge a signature by forcing a misinterpretation of an RSA-PSS key as Ed25519 elliptic-curve data.",
