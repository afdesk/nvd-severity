  "Description": "The IOHIDDevice::handleReportWithTime function in Apple iOS before 9.3.2, OS X before 10.11.5, tvOS before 9.2.1, and watchOS before 2.2.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and memory corruption) via a crafted IOHIDReportType enum, which triggers an incorrect cast, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-1824.",
