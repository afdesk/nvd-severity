  "Description": "libavcodec/tiff.c in FFmpeg before 2.8.6 does not properly validate RowsPerStrip values and YCbCr chrominance subsampling factors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file, related to the tiff_decode_tag and decode_frame functions.",
