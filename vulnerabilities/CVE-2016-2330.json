  "Description": "libavcodec/gif.c in FFmpeg before 2.8.6 does not properly calculate a buffer size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted .tga file, related to the gif_image_write_image, gif_encode_init, and gif_encode_close functions.",
