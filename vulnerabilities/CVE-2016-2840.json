  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange Server 6 / OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev26. The \"session\" parameter for file-download requests can be used to inject script code that gets reflected through the subsequent status page. Malicious script code can be executed within a trusted domain's context. While no OX App Suite specific data can be manipulated, the vulnerability can be exploited without being authenticated and therefore used for social engineering attacks, stealing cookies or redirecting from trustworthy to malicious hosts.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
