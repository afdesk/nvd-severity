The vulnerability is due to improper handling of an HTTP packet stream. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet stream to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.",
