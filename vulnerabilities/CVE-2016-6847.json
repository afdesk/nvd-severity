  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8. SVG files can be used as mp3 album covers. In case their XML structure contains script code, that code may get executed when calling the related cover URL. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).",
