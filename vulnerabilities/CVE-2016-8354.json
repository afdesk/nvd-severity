Unity projects can be compiled as x86 instructions and loaded onto the PLC Simulator delivered with Unity PRO. These x86 instructions are subsequently executed directly by the simulator. A specially crafted patched Unity project file can make the simulator execute malicious code by redirecting the control flow of these instructions.",
