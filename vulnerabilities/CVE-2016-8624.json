  "Description": "curl before version 7.51.0 doesn't parse the authority component of the URL correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character, and could instead be tricked into connecting to a different host. This may have security implications if you for example use an URL parser that follows the RFC to check for allowed domains before using curl to request them.",
