  "Description": "In BMC Patrol before 9.13.10.02, the binary \"listguests64\" is configured with the setuid bit. However, when executing it, it will look for a binary named \"virsh\" using the PATH environment variable. The \"listguests64\" program will then run \"virsh\" using root privileges. This allows local users to elevate their privileges to root.",
