  "Description": "Docker Commons Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use to authenticate with a Docker Registry. This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.",
