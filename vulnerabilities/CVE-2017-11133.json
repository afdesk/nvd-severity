  "Description": "An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. To encrypt messages, AES in CBC mode is used with a pseudo-random secret. This secret and the IV are generated with math.random() in previous versions and with CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random() in newer versions, which uses math.random() internally. This is not cryptographically strong.",
