  "Description": "Inteno routers have a JUCI ACL misconfiguration that allows the \"user\" account to read files, write to files, and add root SSH keys via JSON commands to ubus. (Exploitation is sometimes easy because the \"user\" password might be \"user\" or might match the Wi-Fi key.)",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
