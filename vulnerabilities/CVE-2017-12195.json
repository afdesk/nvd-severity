  "Description": "A flaw was found in all Openshift Enterprise versions using the openshift elasticsearch plugin. An attacker with knowledge of the given name used to authenticate and access Elasticsearch can later access it without the token, bypassing authentication. This attack also requires that the Elasticsearch be configured with an external route, and the data accessed is limited to the indices.",
