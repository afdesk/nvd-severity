  "Description": "An issue was discovered on FiberHome User End Routers Bearing Model Number AN1020-25 which could allow an attacker to easily restore a router to its factory settings by simply browsing to the link http://[Default-Router-IP]/restoreinfo.cgi & execute it. Due to improper authentication on this page, the software accepts the request hence allowing attacker to reset the router to its default configurations which later could allow attacker to login to router by using default username/password.",
