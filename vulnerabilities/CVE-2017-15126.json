  "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/userfaultfd.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.6. The issue is related to the handling of fork failure when dealing with event messages. Failure to fork correctly can lead to a situation where a fork event will be removed from an already freed list of events with userfaultfd_ctx_put().",
