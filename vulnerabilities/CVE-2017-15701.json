  "Description": "In Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.4 (inclusive) the broker does not properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0 frames. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate. Older AMQP protocols are not affected.",
