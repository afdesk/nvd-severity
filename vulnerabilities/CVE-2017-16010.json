  "Description": "i18next is a language translation framework. When using the .init method, passing interpolation options without passing an escapeValue will default to undefined rather than the assumed true. This can result in a cross-site scripting vulnerability because user input is assumed to be escaped, but is not. This vulnerability affects i18next 2.0.0 and later.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
