  "Description": "The sync-exec module is used to simulate child_process.execSync in node versions <0.11.9. Sync-exec uses tmp directories as a buffer before returning values. Other users on the server have read access to the tmp directory, possibly allowing an attacker on the server to obtain confidential information from the buffer/tmp file, while it exists.",
