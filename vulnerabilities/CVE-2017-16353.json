  "Description": "GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 is vulnerable to a memory information disclosure vulnerability found in the DescribeImage function of the magick/describe.c file, because of a heap-based buffer over-read. The portion of the code containing the vulnerability is responsible for printing the IPTC Profile information contained in the image. This vulnerability can be triggered with a specially crafted MIFF file. There is an out-of-bounds buffer dereference because certain increments are never checked.",
