  "Description": "The DefaultLinuxSpec function in oci/defaults.go in Docker Moby through 17.03.2-ce does not block /proc/scsi pathnames, which allows attackers to trigger data loss (when certain older Linux kernels are used) by leveraging Docker container access to write a \"scsi remove-single-device\" line to /proc/scsi/scsi, aka SCSI MICDROP.",
