  "Description": "In Laravel framework through 5.5.21, remote attackers can obtain sensitive information (such as externally usable passwords) via a direct request for the /.env URI. NOTE: this CVE is only about Laravel framework's writeNewEnvironmentFileWith function in src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/KeyGenerateCommand.php, which uses file_put_contents without restricting the .env permissions. The .env filename is not used exclusively by Laravel framework.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
