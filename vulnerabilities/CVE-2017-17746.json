  "Description": "Weak access control methods on the TP-Link TL-SG108E 1.0.0 allow any user on a NAT network with an authenticated administrator to access the device without entering user credentials. The authentication record is stored on the device; thus if an administrator authenticates from a NAT network, the authentication applies to the IP address of the NAT gateway, and any user behind that NAT gateway is also treated as authenticated.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
