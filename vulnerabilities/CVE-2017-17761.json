  "Description": "An issue was discovered on Ichano AtHome IP Camera devices. The device runs the \"noodles\" binary - a service on port 1300 that allows a remote (LAN) unauthenticated user to run arbitrary commands. This binary requires the \"system\" XML element for specifying the command. For example, a <system>id</system> command results in a <system_ack>ok</system_ack> response.",
