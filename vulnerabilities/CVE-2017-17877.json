  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Valve Steam Link build 643. When the SSH daemon is enabled for local development, the device is publicly available via IPv6 TCP port 22 over the internet (with stateless address autoconfiguration) by default, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by guessing 24 bits of the MAC address and attempting a root login. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2017-17878.",
