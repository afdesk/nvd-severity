  "Description": "The debug handler in Symfony before v2.7.33, 2.8.x before v2.8.26, 3.x before v3.2.13, and 3.3.x before v3.3.6 has XSS via an array key during exception pretty printing in ExceptionHandler.php, as demonstrated by a /_debugbar/open?op=get URI. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is not a vulnerability because the debug tools are not intended for production use. NOTE: the Symfony Debug component is used by Laravel Debugbar",
