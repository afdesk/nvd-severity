  "Description": "UCanCode E-XD++ Visualization Enterprise Suite contains an untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability via the TKDRAWCAD.TKDrawCADCtrl.1 ActiveX control. This is because it exposes a RotateShape method that dereferences a user-supplied pointer without sufficient validation. A crafted input may cause the control to dereference an attacker-controlled pointer, enabling remote code execution in the context of the hosting process. The vulnerability requires user interaction (instantiation of the ActiveX control via a web page or a file).",
