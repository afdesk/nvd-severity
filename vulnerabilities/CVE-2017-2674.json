  "Description": "JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 before 6.4.3 are vulnerable to a stored XSS via several lists in Business Central. The flaw is due to lack of sanitation of user input when creating new lists. Remote, authenticated attackers that have privileges to create lists can store scripts in them, which are not properly sanitized before showing to other users, including admins.",
