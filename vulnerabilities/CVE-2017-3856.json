  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web user interface of Cisco IOS XE 3.1 through 3.17 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to insufficient resource handling by the affected software when the web user interface is under a high load. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of requests to the web user interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have access to the management interface of the affected software, which is typically connected to a restricted management network. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, if the web user interface of the software is enabled. By default, the web user interface is not enabled. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCup70353.",
