  "Description": "In Wireshark 2.2.4 and earlier, a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607 capture file will cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the packet size field in a packet header is null, the offset to read from will not advance, causing continuous attempts to read the same zero length packet. This will quickly exhaust all system memory.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
