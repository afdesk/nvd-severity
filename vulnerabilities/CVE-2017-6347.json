  "Description": "The ip_cmsg_recv_checksum function in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.1 has incorrect expectations about skb data layout, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, as demonstrated by use of the MSG_MORE flag in conjunction with loopback UDP transmission.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
