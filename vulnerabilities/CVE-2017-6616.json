  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) 3.0(1c) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently sanitize specific values that are received as part of a user-supplied HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14578.",
