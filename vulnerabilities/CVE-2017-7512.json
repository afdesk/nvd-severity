  "Description": "Red Hat 3scale (aka RH-3scale) API Management Platform (AMP) before 2.0.0 would permit creation of an access token without a client secret. An attacker could use this flaw to circumvent authentication controls and gain access to restricted APIs. NOTE: some sources have a typo in which CVE-2017-7512 maps to an OpenVPN vulnerability. The proper CVE ID for that OpenVPN vulnerability is CVE-2017-7521. Specifically, CVE-2017-7521 is the correct CVE ID for TWO closely related findings in OpenVPN. Any source that lists BOTH CVE-2017-7512 and CVE-2017-7521 for OpenVPN should have listed ONLY CVE-2017-7521.",
