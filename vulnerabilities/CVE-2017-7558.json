  "Description": "A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel in inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and sctp_get_sctp_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace.",
