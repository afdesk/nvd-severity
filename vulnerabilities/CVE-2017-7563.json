  "Description": "In ARM Trusted Firmware 1.3, RO memory is always executable at AArch64 Secure EL1, allowing attackers to bypass the MT_EXECUTE_NEVER protection mechanism. This issue occurs because of inconsistency in the number of execute-never bits (one bit versus two bits).",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
