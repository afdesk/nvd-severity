  "Description": "drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dw2102.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.4 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
