  "Description": "An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. By connecting to the Mosquitto broker on an access point and one of its clients, an attacker can gather enough information to craft a command that reboots the client remotely when sent to the client's Mosquitto broker, aka \"unauthenticated remote command execution.\" This command can be re-sent endlessly to act as a DoS attack on the client.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
