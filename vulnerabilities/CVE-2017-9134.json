  "Description": "An information-leakage issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. There is a page in the web interface that will show you the device's serial number, regardless of whether or not you have logged in. This information-leakage issue is relevant because there is another page (accessible without any authentication) that allows you to remotely factory reset the device simply by entering the serial number.",
