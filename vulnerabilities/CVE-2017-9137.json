  "Description": "Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 wireless radios through 7.2.0 have a default password of mateidu for the mateidu account (a hidden user account established by the vendor). This account can be accessed via both the web interface and SSH. In the web interface, this simply grants an attacker read-only access to the device's settings. However, when using SSH, this gives an attacker access to a Linux shell. NOTE: the vendor has commented \"The mateidu user is a known user, which is mentioned in the FibeAir IP-10 User Guide. Customers are instructed to change the mateidu user password. Changing the user password fully solves the vulnerability.\"",
