  "Description": "In all Qualcomm products with Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, in function msm_compr_ioctl_shared, variable \"ddp->params_length\" could be accessed and modified by multiple threads, while it is not protected with locks. If one thread is running, while another thread is setting data, race conditions will happen. If \"ddp->params_length\" is set to a big number, a buffer overflow will occur.",
