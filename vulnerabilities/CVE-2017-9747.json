  "Description": "The ieee_archive_p function in bfd/ieee.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during \"objdump -D\" execution. NOTE: this may be related to a compiler bug.",
