  "Description": "bfd/vms-alpha.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file in the _bfd_vms_get_value and _bfd_vms_slurp_etir functions during \"objdump -D\" execution.",
