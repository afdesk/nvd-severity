  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. All inverters have a very weak password policy for the user and installer password. No complexity requirements or length requirements are set. Also, strong passwords are impossible due to a maximum of 12 characters and a limited set of characters. NOTE: the vendor reports that the 12-character limit provides \"a very high security standard.\" Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.",
