  "Description": "A vulnerability in the FTP server of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the FTP server of the device without a valid password. The attacker does need to have a valid username. The vulnerability is due to incorrect FTP user credential validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using FTP to connect to the management IP address of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the FTP server of the Cisco WSA without having a valid password. This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Software on both virtual and hardware appliances that are running any release of Cisco AsyncOS 10.5.1 for WSA Software. The device is vulnerable only if FTP is enabled on the management interface. FTP is disabled by default. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf74281.",
