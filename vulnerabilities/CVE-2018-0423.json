  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition or to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to improper boundary restrictions on user-supplied input in the Guest user feature of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted device, triggering a buffer overflow condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service condition, or could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
