  "Description": "An issue was discovered in GEGL through 0.3.32. The gegl_buffer_iterate_read_simple function in buffer/gegl-buffer-access.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (write access violation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed PPM file, related to improper restrictions on memory allocation in the ppm_load_read_header function in operations/external/ppm-load.c.",
