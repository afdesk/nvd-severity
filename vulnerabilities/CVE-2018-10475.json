  "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 9.0.0.29935. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D Light Node structures. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated structure.
