  "Description": "An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for WAV input. Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseRiffHeaderConfig in riff.c does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to insufficient memory allocation.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
