  "Description": "CNCSoft Version 1.00.83 and prior with ScreenEditor Version 1.00.54 has multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could cause the software to crash due to lacking user input validation before copying data from project files onto the stack. Which may allow an attacker to gain remote code execution with administrator privileges if exploited.",
