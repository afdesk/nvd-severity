  "Description": "ModbusPal 1.6b is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. Projects are saved as .xmpp files and automations can be exported as .xmpa files, both XML-based, which are vulnerable to XXE injection. Sending a crafted .xmpp or .xmpa file to a user, when opened/imported in ModbusPal, will return the contents of any local files to a remote attacker.",
