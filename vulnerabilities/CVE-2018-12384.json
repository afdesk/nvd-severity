  "Description": "When handling a SSLv2-compatible ClientHello request, the server doesn't generate a new random value but sends an all-zero value instead. This results in full malleability of the ClientHello for SSLv2 used for TLS 1.2 in all versions prior to NSS 3.39. This does not impact TLS 1.3.",
