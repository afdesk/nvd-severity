  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options are used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of an off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic scenarios in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire purpose of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands.",
