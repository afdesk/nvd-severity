  "Description": "The Linux kernel before 4.15-rc8 was found to be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference bug in the __netlink_ns_capable() function in the net/netlink/af_netlink.c file. A local attacker could exploit this when a net namespace with a netnsid is assigned to cause a kernel panic and a denial of service.",
