  "Description": "In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with a double \"To\" header and an empty \"To\" tag causes a segmentation fault and crash. The reason is missing input validation in the \"build_res_buf_from_sip_req\" core function. This could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.",
