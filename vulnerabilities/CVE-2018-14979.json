This app contains an exported service app component named com.asus.loguploader.LogUploaderService that, when accessed with a particular action string, will write a bugreport (kernel log, logcat log, and the state of system services including the text of active notifications), Wi-Fi Passwords, and other system data to external storage (sdcard). Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission on this device can read this data from the sdcard after it has been dumped there by the com.asus.loguploader. Third-party apps are not allowed to directly create a bugreport or access the user's stored wireless network credentials.",
