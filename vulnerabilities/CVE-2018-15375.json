  "Description": "A vulnerability in the embedded test subsystem of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write arbitrary values to arbitrary locations in the memory space of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the presence of certain test commands that were intended to be available only in internal development builds of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using these commands on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary values to arbitrary locations in the memory space of the affected device.",
