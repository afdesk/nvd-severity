  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.18.6. An information leak in cdrom_ioctl_drive_status in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c could be used by local attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from unsigned long to int interferes with bounds checking. This is similar to CVE-2018-10940.",
