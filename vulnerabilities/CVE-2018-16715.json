  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Absolute Software CTES Windows Agent through 1.0.0.1479. The security permissions on the %ProgramData%\\CTES folder and sub-folders may allow write access to low-privileged user accounts. This allows unauthorized replacement of service program executable (EXE) or dynamically loadable library (DLL) files, causing elevated (SYSTEM) user access. Configuration control files or data files under this folder could also be similarly modified to affect service process behavior.",
