  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that allows the userspace to call memcpy_fromiovecend() and similar functions with a zero offset and buffer length which causes the read beyond the buffer boundaries, in certain cases causing a memory access fault and a system halt by accessing invalid memory address. This issue only affects kernel version 3.10.x as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
