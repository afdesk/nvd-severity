  "Description": "An issue was discovered in JABA XPress Online Shop through 2018-09-14. It contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the picture-upload feature of ProductEdit.aspx. An authenticated attacker may bypass the frontend filename validation and upload an arbitrary file via FileUploader.aspx.cs in FileUploader.aspx by using empty w and h parameters. This file may contain arbitrary aspx code that may be executed by accessing /Jec/ProductImages/<number>/<filename>. Accessing the file once uploaded does not require authentication.",
