  "Description": "An issue was discovered in PrinterOn Central Print Services (CPS) through 4.1.4. The core components that create and launch a print job do not perform complete verification of the session cookie that is supplied to them. As a result, an attacker with guest/pseudo-guest level permissions can bypass the session checks (that would otherwise logout a low-privileged user) by calling the core print job components directly via crafted HTTP GET and POST requests.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
