  "Description": "An issue was discovered in WAVM before 2018-09-16. The loadModule function in Include/Inline/CLI.h lacks checking of the file length before a file magic comparison, allowing attackers to cause a Denial of Service (application crash caused by out-of-bounds read) by crafting a file that has fewer than 4 bytes.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
