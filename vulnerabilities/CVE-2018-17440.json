  "Description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link Central WiFi Manager before v 1.03r0100-Beta1. They expose an FTP server that serves by default on port 9000 and has hardcoded credentials (admin, admin). Taking advantage of this, a remote unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading any file in the web root directory and then accessing it via a request.",
