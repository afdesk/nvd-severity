  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.19. An information leak in cdrom_ioctl_select_disc in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c could be used by local attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from unsigned long to int interferes with bounds checking. This is similar to CVE-2018-10940 and CVE-2018-16658.",
