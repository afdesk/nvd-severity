  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** GNOME Keyring through 3.28.2 allows local users to retrieve login credentials via a Secret Service API call and the D-Bus interface if the keyring is unlocked, a similar issue to CVE-2008-7320. One perspective is that this occurs because available D-Bus protection mechanisms (involving the busconfig and policy XML elements) are not used. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because, according to the security model, untrusted applications must not be allowed to access the user's session bus socket.",
