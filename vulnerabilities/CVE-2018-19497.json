  "Description": "In The Sleuth Kit (TSK) through 4.6.4, hfs_cat_traverse in tsk/fs/hfs.c does not properly determine when a key length is too large, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (SEGV on unknown address with READ memory access in a tsk_getu16 call in hfs_dir_open_meta_cb in tsk/fs/hfs_dent.c).",
