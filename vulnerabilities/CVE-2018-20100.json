  "Description": "An issue was discovered on August Connect devices. Insecure data transfer between the August app and August Connect during configuration allows attackers to discover home Wi-Fi credentials. This data transfer uses an unencrypted access point for these credentials, and passes them in an HTTP POST, using the AugustWifiDevice class, with data encrypted with a fixed key found obfuscated in the app.",
