  "Description": "An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the DHCP daemon configuration of the CUJO Smart Firewall. When adding a new static DHCP address, its corresponding hostname is inserted into the dhcpd.conf file without prior sanitization, allowing for arbitrary execution of system commands. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker can send a DHCP request message and set up the corresponding static DHCP entry.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
