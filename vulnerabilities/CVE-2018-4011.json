  "Description": "An exploitable integer underflow vulnerability exists in the mdnscap binary of the CUJO Smart Firewall, version 7003. When parsing SRV records in an mDNS packet, the \"RDLENGTH\" value is handled incorrectly, leading to an out-of-bounds access that crashes the mdnscap process. An unauthenticated attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
