  "Description": "A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a \"script-src\" policy of \"'strict-dynamic'\". If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the \"require.js\" library that is part of Firefox's Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.",
