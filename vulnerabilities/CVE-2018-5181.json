  "Description": "If a URL using the \"file:\" protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the \"noopener\" keyword. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.",
