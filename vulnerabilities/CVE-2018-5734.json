  "Description": "While handling a particular type of malformed packet BIND erroneously selects a SERVFAIL rcode instead of a FORMERR rcode. If the receiving view has the SERVFAIL cache feature enabled, this can trigger an assertion failure in badcache.c when the request doesn't contain all of the expected information. Affects BIND 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.5-S4, 9.10.6-S1, 9.10.6-S2.",
