  "Description": "The function ParseVP9SuperFrameIndex in common/libwebm_util.cc in libwebm through 2018-01-30 does not validate the child_frame_length data obtained from a .webm file, which allows remote attackers to cause an information leak or a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and later out-of-bounds write), or possibly have unspecified other impact.",
