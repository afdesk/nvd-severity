  "Description": "VMware ESXi (6.7, 6.5, 6.0), Workstation (15.x and 14.x) and Fusion (11.x and 10.x) contain a denial-of-service vulnerability due to an infinite loop in a 3D-rendering shader. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow an attacker with normal user privileges in the guest to make the VM unresponsive, and in some cases, possibly result other VMs on the host or the host itself becoming unresponsive.",
