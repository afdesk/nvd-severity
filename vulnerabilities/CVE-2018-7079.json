  "Description": "Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager guest authorization failure. Certain administrative operations in ClearPass Guest do not properly enforce authorization rules, which allows any authenticated administrative user to execute those operations regardless of privilege level. This could allow low-privilege users to view, modify, or delete guest users. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.6 and 6.6.10-hotfix.",
