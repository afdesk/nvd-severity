  "Description": "A remote code execution issue was discovered in GLPI through 9.2.1. There is a race condition that allows temporary access to an uploaded executable file that will be disallowed. The application allows an authenticated user to upload a file when he/she creates a new ticket via front/fileupload.php. This feature is protected using different types of security features like the check on the file's extension. However, the application uploads and creates a file, though this file is not allowed, and then deletes the file in the uploadFiles method in inc/glpiuploaderhandler.class.php.",
