  "Description": "In the Mediatek Preloader, there are out of bounds reads and writes due to an exposed interface that allows arbitrary peripheral memory mapping with insufficient blacklisting/whitelisting. This could lead to local elevation of privilege, given physical access to the device with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.",
