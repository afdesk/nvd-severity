  "Description": "In \u00a0RsaKeyPairGenerator::getNumberOfIterations of RSAKeyPairGenerator.java,\u00a0an incorrect implementation could cause weak RSA key pairs being generated.\u00a0This could lead to crypto vulnerability with no additional execution\u00a0privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.\u00a0Bulletin Fix: The fix is designed to correctly implement the key generation according to FIPS standard.",
