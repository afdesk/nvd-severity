  "Description": "Receipt of a malformed packet on MX Series devices with dynamic vlan configuration can trigger an uncontrolled recursion loop in the Broadband Edge subscriber management daemon (bbe-smgd), and lead to high CPU usage and a crash of the bbe-smgd service. Repeated receipt of the same packet can result in an extended denial of service condition for the device.
