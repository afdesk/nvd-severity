  "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly validate input from an authenticated user on a guest operating system. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application on a guest operating system that could cause the Hyper-V host operating system to execute arbitrary code.\nAn attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Hyper-V validates guest operating system user input.",
