  "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Installer when the Windows Installer fails to properly sanitize input leading to an insecure library loading behavior.\nA locally authenticated attacker could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the input sanitization error to preclude unintended elevation.",
