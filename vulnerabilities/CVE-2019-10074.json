  "Description": "An RCE is possible by entering Freemarker markup in an Apache OFBiz Form Widget textarea field when encoding has been disabled on such a field. This was the case for the Customer Request \"story\" input in the Order Manager application. Encoding should not be disabled without good reason and never within a field that accepts user input. Mitigation: Upgrade to 16.11.06 or manually apply the following commit on branch 16.11: r1858533",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
