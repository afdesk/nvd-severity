  "Description": "A flaw was found in ansible 2.8.0 before 2.8.4. Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by no_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set properly. service_account_contents() which is common class for all gcp modules is not setting no_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.",
