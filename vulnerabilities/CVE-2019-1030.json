  "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge based on Edge HTML improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user\u2019s system.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge based on Edge HTML handles objects in memory.\n",
