  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** The Linux kernel through 5.0.7, when CONFIG_IA32_AOUT is enabled and ia32_aout is loaded, allows local users to bypass ASLR on setuid a.out programs (if any exist) because install_exec_creds() is called too late in load_aout_binary() in fs/binfmt_aout.c, and thus the ptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability because ASLR for a.out format executables has never been supported.",
  "Severity": "LOW"
