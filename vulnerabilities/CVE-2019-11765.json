  "Description": "A compromised content process could send a message to the parent process that would cause the 'Click to Play' permission prompt to be shown. However, due to lack of validation from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission request an attacker-controlled permission would be granted rather than the 'Click to Play' permission. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70.",
