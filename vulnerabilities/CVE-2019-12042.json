  "Description": "Insecure permissions of the section object Global\\PandaDevicesAgentSharedMemory and the event Global\\PandaDevicesAgentSharedMemoryChange in Panda products before 18.07.03 allow attackers to queue an event (as an encrypted JSON string) to the system service AgentSvc.exe, which leads to privilege escalation when the CmdLineExecute event is queued. This affects Panda Antivirus, Panda Antivirus Pro, Panda Dome, Panda Global Protection, Panda Gold Protection, and Panda Internet Security.",
