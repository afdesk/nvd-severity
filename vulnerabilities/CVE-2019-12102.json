  "Description": "Kentico 11 through 12 lets attackers upload and explore files without authentication via the cmsmodules/medialibrary/formcontrols/liveselectors/insertimageormedia/tabs_media.aspx URI. NOTE: The vendor disputes the report because the researcher did not configure the media library permissions correctly. The vendor states that by default all users can read/modify/upload files, and it\u2019s up to the administrator to decide who should have access to the media library and set the permissions accordingly. See the vendor documentation in the references for more information",
