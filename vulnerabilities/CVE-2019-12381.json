  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: this is disputed because new_ra is never used if it is NULL.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
