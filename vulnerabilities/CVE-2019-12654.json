  "Description": "A vulnerability in the common Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) library of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanity checks on an internal data structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of malicious SIP messages to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a crash of the iosd process. This triggers a reload of the device.",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
