  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Sonic Robo Blast 2 (SRB2) plugin (EP_Versions 9 to 11 inclusive) distributed with Doomseeker 1.1 and 1.2. Affected plugin versions did not discard IP packets with an unnaturally long response length from a Sonic Robo Blast 2 master server, allowing a remote attacker to cause a potential crash / denial of service in Doomseeker. The issue has been remediated in the Doomseeker 1.3 release with source code patches to the SRB2 plugin.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
