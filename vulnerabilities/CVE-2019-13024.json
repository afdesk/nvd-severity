  "Description": "Centreon 18.x before 18.10.6, 19.x before 19.04.3, and Centreon web before 2.8.29 allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by using the value \"init_script\"-\"Monitoring Engine Binary\" in main.get.php to insert a arbitrary command into the database, and execute it by calling the vulnerable page www/include/configuration/configGenerate/xml/generateFiles.php (which passes the inserted value to the database to shell_exec without sanitizing it, allowing one to execute system arbitrary commands).",
