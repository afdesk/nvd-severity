  "Description": "Profinet-IO (PNIO) stack versions prior V06.00 do not properly limit\ninternal resource allocation when multiple legitimate diagnostic package\nrequests are sent to the DCE-RPC interface.\nThis could lead to a denial of service condition due to lack of memory\nfor devices that include a vulnerable version of the stack.\n\nThe security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network\naccess to an affected device. Successful exploitation requires no system\nprivileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability\nto compromise the availability of the device.",
