  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. Due to the behaviour of the underlying HTMLParser, django.utils.html.strip_tags would be extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs containing large sequences of nested incomplete HTML entities.",
