Once successfully authenticated as an administrator, one is able to inject arbitrary PHP code by using the adminCons.php form. The code is then stored in the E:\\PUBLISURE\\webservice\\webpages\\AdminDir\\Templates\\ folder even if removed from the adminCons.php view (i.e., the rogue PHP file can be hidden).",
