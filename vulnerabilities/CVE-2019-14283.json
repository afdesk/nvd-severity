  "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.2.3, set_geometry in drivers/block/floppy.c does not validate the sect and head fields, as demonstrated by an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read. It can be triggered by an unprivileged local user when a floppy disk has been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default.",
