  "Description": "Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3 doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying certain block labels created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized label, then have an administrator execute scripting when administering a layout. (This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permission to create custom blocks on the site, which is typically an administrative permission.)",
