  "Description": "In Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3, some menu links within the administration bar may be crafted to execute JavaScript when the administrator is logged in and uses the search functionality. (This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permissions to create administrative menu links, such as by creating a content type or layout. Such permissions are usually restricted to trusted or administrative users.)",
