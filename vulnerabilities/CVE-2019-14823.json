  "Description": "A flaw was found in the \"Leaf and Chain\" OCSP policy implementation in JSS' CryptoManager versions after 4.4.6, 4.5.3, 4.6.0, where it implicitly trusted the root certificate of a certificate chain. Applications using this policy may not properly verify the chain and could be vulnerable to attacks such as Man in the Middle.",
