  "Description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.2.14 on the powerpc platform, a local user can read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility Unavailable exception. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin) and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check.",
