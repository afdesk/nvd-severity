  "Description": "Default installations of Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus 10.0 before 10500 are vulnerable to XSS injected by a workstation local administrator. Using the installed program names of the computer as a vector, the local administrator can execute code on the Manage Engine ServiceDesk administrator side. At \"Asset Home > Server > <workstation> > software\" the administrator of ManageEngine can control what software is installed on the workstation. This table shows all the installed program names in the Software column. In this field, a remote attacker can inject malicious code in order to execute it when the ManageEngine administrator visualizes this page.",
