  "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during the initial High Availability (HA) configuration and registration process of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file during the HA registration period. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited during the HA registration period. See the Details section for more information.",
