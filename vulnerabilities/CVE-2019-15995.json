  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco DNA Spaces: Connector could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering malicious SQL statements in an affected field in the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remove the SQL database, which would require the reinstallation of the Connector VM.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
