  "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for the Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected phone to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet to the targeted phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected phone to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary DoS condition. Versions prior to 12.6(1)MN80 are affected.",
