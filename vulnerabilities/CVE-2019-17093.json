A DLL Preloading vulnerability allows an attacker to implant %WINDIR%\\system32\\wbemcomn.dll, which is loaded into a protected-light process (PPL) and might bypass some of the self-defense mechanisms. This affects all components that use WMI, e.g., AVGSvc.exe 19.6.4546.0 and TuneupSmartScan.dll 19.1.884.0.",
