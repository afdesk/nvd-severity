  "Description": "A vulnerability in the Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. This vulnerability is due to a parsing issue on DNS packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted DNS packets through routers that are running an affected version and have NBAR enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
