  "Description": "A vulnerability in the HTTPS decryption feature of Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server certificates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a malformed certificate in a web server and sending a request to it through the Cisco WSA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the proxy process on an affected device.",
