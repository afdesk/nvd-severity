  "Description": "The HMISimulator component of ABB PB610 Panel Builder 600 uses the readFile/writeFile interface to manipulate the work file. Path configuration in PB610 HMISimulator versions 2.8.0.424 and earlier potentially allows access to files outside of the working directory, thus potentially supporting unauthorized file access.",
