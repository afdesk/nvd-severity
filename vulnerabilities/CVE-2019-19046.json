  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the __ipmi_bmc_register() function in drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering ida_simple_get() failure, aka CID-4aa7afb0ee20. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because an attacker cannot realistically control this failure at probe time.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
