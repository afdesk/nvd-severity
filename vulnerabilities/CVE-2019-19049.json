  "Description": "A memory leak in the unittest_data_add() function in drivers/of/unittest.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.10 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering of_fdt_unflatten_tree() failures, aka CID-e13de8fe0d6a. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because unittest.c can only be reached during boot",
