  "Description": "During installation of an OpenShift 4 cluster, the `openshift-install` command line tool creates an `auth` directory, with `kubeconfig` and `kubeadmin-password` files. Both files contain credentials used to authenticate to the OpenShift API server, and are incorrectly assigned word-readable permissions. ose-installer as shipped in Openshift 4.2 is vulnerable.",
