  "Description": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted f2fs filesystem image can lead to slab-out-of-bounds read access in f2fs_build_segment_manager in fs/f2fs/segment.c, related to init_min_max_mtime in fs/f2fs/segment.c (because the second argument to get_seg_entry is not validated).",
