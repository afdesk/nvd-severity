  "Description": "An issue was discovered in TYPO3 before 8.7.30, 9.x before 9.5.12, and 10.x before 10.2.2. Because escaping of user-submitted content is mishandled, the class QueryGenerator is vulnerable to SQL injection. Exploitation requires having the system extension ext:lowlevel installed, and a valid backend user who has administrator privileges.",
