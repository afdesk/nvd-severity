  "Description": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered in Subrion CMS 4.2.1 that allows a remote attacker to remove files on the server without a victim's knowledge, by enticing an authenticated user to visit an attacker's web page. The application fails to validate the CSRF token for a GET request. An attacker can craft a panel/uploads/read.json?cmd=rm URL (removing this token) and send it to the victim.",
