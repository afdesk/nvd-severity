  "Description": "An issue was discovered on TK-Star Q90 Junior GPS horloge 3.1042.9.8656 devices. Any SIM card used with the device cannot have a PIN configured. If a PIN is configured, the device simply produces a \"Remove PIN and restart!\" message, and cannot be used. This makes it easier for an attacker to use the SIM card by stealing the device.",
