  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetlabel: fix out-of-bounds memory accesses\n\nThere are two array out-of-bounds memory accesses, one in\ncipso_v4_map_lvl_valid(), the other in netlbl_bitmap_walk().  Both\nerrors are embarassingly simple, and the fixes are straightforward.\n\nAs a FYI for anyone backporting this patch to kernels prior to v4.8,\nyou'll want to apply the netlbl_bitmap_walk() patch to\ncipso_v4_bitmap_walk() as netlbl_bitmap_walk() doesn't exist before\nLinux v4.8.",
