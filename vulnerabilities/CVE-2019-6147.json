  "Description": "Forcepoint NGFW Security Management Center (SMC) versions lower than 6.5.12 or 6.7.1 have a rare issue that in specific circumstances can corrupt the internal configuration database. When the database is corrupted, the SMC might produce an incorrect IPsec configuration for the Forcepoint Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), possibly resulting in settings that are weaker than expected. All SMC versions lower than 6.5.12 or 6.7.1 are vulnerable.",
