  "Description": "An issue was discovered in GPU-Z.sys in TechPowerUp GPU-Z before 2.23.0. The vulnerable driver exposes a wrmsr instruction via an IOCTL and does not properly filter the Model Specific Register (MSR). Allowing arbitrary MSR writes can lead to Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.",
