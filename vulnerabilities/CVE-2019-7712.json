  "Description": "An issue was discovered in handler_ipcom_shell_pwd in the Interpeak IPCOMShell TELNET server on Green Hills INTEGRITY RTOS 5.0.4. When using the pwd command, the current working directory path is used as the first argument to printf() without a proper check. An attacker may thus forge a path containing format string modifiers to get a custom format string evaluated. This results in an information leak of memory addresses.",
