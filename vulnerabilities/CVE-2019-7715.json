  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Interpeak IPCOMShell TELNET server on Green Hills INTEGRITY RTOS 5.0.4. The main shell handler function uses the value of the environment variable ipcom.shell.greeting as the first argument to printf(). Setting this variable using the sysvar command results in a user-controlled format string during login, resulting in an information leak of memory addresses.",
