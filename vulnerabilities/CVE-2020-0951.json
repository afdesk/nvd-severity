An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute PowerShell commands that would be blocked by WDAC.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker need administrator access on a local machine where PowerShell is running. The attacker could then connect to a PowerShell session and send commands to execute arbitrary code.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell commands are validated when WDAC protection is enabled.</p>\n",
