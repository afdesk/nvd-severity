To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 2.22.7 and was fixed in 2.22.7, 2.21.15, and 2.20.24. The underlying issues contributing to this vulnerability were identified through the GitHub Security Bug Bounty program.",
