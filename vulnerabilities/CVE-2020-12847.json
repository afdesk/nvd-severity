  "Description": "Pydio Cells 2.0.4 web application offers an administrative console named \u201cCells Console\u201d that is available to users with an administrator role. This console provides an administrator user with the possibility of changing several settings, including the application\u2019s mailer configuration. It is possible to configure a few engines to be used by the mailer application to send emails. If the user selects the \u201csendmail\u201d option as the default one, the web application offers to edit the full path where the sendmail binary is hosted. Since there is no restriction in place while editing this value, an attacker authenticated as an administrator user could force the web application into executing any arbitrary binary.",
