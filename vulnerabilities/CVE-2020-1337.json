  "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly allows arbitrary writing to the file system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted script or application.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Print Spooler Component writes to the file system.\n",
