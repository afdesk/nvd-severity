  "Description": "In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, by controlling the `fill` argument of tf.strings.as_string, a malicious attacker is able to trigger a format string vulnerability due to the way the internal format use in a `printf` call is constructed. This may result in segmentation fault. The issue is patched in commit 33be22c65d86256e6826666662e40dbdfe70ee83, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.",
