  "Description": "In lookatme (python/pypi package) versions prior to 2.3.0, the package automatically loaded the built-in \"terminal\" and \"file_loader\" extensions. Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.",
