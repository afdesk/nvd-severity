An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>\n<p>In a HTML editing attack scenario, an attacker could trick a user into editing a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how MSHTML engine validates input.</p>\n",
