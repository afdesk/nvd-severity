  "Description": "An issue was discovered in FNET through 4.6.4. The code for processing the hop-by-hop header (in the IPv6 extension headers) doesn't check for a valid length of an extension header, and therefore an out-of-bounds read can occur in _fnet_ip6_ext_header_handler_options in fnet_ip6.c, leading to Denial-of-Service.",
