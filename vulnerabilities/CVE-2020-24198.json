  "Description": "A persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability in Sourcecodester Stock Management System v1.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the 'Brand Name.' NOTE: The vendor states that the RTSP library is used for DEMO only, using it in product is a customer's behavior. Ambarella has emphasized that RTSP is DEMO only library, should NOT be used in product in our document.
