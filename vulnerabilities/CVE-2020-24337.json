  "Description": "An issue was discovered in picoTCP and picoTCP-NG through 1.7.0. When an unsupported TCP option with zero length is provided in an incoming TCP packet, it is possible to cause a Denial-of-Service by achieving an infinite loop in the code that parses TCP options, aka tcp_parse_options() in pico_tcp.c.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
