  "Description": "The affected versions of S+ Operations (version 2.1 SP1 and earlier) used an approach for user authentication which relies on validation at the client node (client-side authentication). This is not as secure as having the server validate a client application before allowing a connection. Therefore, if the network communication or endpoints for these applications are not protected, unauthorized actors can bypass authentication and make unauthorized connections to the server application.",
