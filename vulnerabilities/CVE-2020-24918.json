  "Description": "A buffer overflow in the RTSP service of the Ambarella Oryx RTSP Server 2020-01-07 allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a crafted RTSP request, with a long digest authentication header, to execute arbitrary code in parse_authentication_header() in libamprotocol-rtsp.so.1 in rtsp_svc (or cause a crash). This allows remote takeover of a Furbo Dog Camera, for example.",
