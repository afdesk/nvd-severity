  "Description": "A buffer overflow in the RTSP service of the Ambarella Oryx RTSP Server 2020-01-07 allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a crafted RTSP request, with a long digest authentication header, to execute arbitrary code in parse_authentication_header() in libamprotocol-rtsp.so.1 in rtsp_svc (or cause a crash). This allows remote takeover of a Furbo Dog Camera, for example. NOTE: The vendor states that the RTSP library is used for DEMO only, using it in product is a customer's behavior. Ambarella has emphasized that RTSP is DEMO only library, should NOT be used in product in our document. Because Ambarella's SDK is proprietary, we didn't publish our SDK source code in public network.",
