  "Description": "Cron-utils is a Java library to parse, validate, migrate crons as well as get human readable descriptions for them. In cron-utils before version 9.1.3, a template Injection vulnerability is present. This enables attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Only projects using the @Cron annotation to validate untrusted Cron expressions are affected. This issue was patched in version 9.1.3.",
