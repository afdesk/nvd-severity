  "Description": "In oauth2-server (aka node-oauth2-server) through 3.1.1, the value of the redirect_uri parameter received during the authorization and token request is checked against an incorrect URI pattern (\"[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9+.-]+:\") before making a redirection. This allows a malicious client to pass an XSS payload through the redirect_uri parameter while making an authorization request. NOTE: this vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-7741.",
