  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0.2), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0.2). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing ASM files. This could lead to pointer dereferences of a value obtained from untrusted source. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-11899)",
