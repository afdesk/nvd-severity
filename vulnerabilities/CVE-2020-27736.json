  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), APOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.20), APOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), APOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.20), Nucleus NET (All versions), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 (All versions < V2017.02.3), Nucleus ReadyStart V4 (All versions < V4.1.0), Nucleus Source Code (Versions including affected DNS modules), SIMOTICS CONNECT 400 (All versions < V0.5.0.0), TALON TC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), TALON TC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5). The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the null-terminated name in DNS-responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the read memory.",
