  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0.1), Solid Edge SE2020 (All Versions < SE2020MP12), Solid Edge SE2021 (All Versions < SE2021MP2), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0.1). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This can result in an out of bounds write past the memory location that is a read only image address. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-11885)",
