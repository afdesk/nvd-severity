  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE PXC Series (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), APOGEE PXC Series (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.20), Nucleus NET (All versions < V5.2), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 (All versions < V2012.12), Nucleus Source Code (All versions), PLUSCONTROL 1st Gen (All versions), TALON TC Series (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5). Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufficiently random source. As a result, the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker could hijack existing sessions or spoof future ones.",
