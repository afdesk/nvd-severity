  "Description": "An issue was discovered on Athom Homey and Homey Pro devices before 5.0.0. ZigBee hub devices should generate a unique Standard Network Key that is then exchanged with all enrolled devices so that all inter-device communication is encrypted. However, the cited Athom products use another widely known key that is designed for testing purposes: \"01030507090b0d0f00020406080a0c0d\" (the decimal equivalent of 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 13), which is human generated and static across all issued devices.",
