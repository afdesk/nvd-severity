  "Description": "SphinxSearch in Sphinx Technologies Sphinx through 3.1.1 allows directory traversal (in conjunction with CVE-2019-14511) because the mysql client can be used for CALL SNIPPETS and load_file operations on a full pathname (e.g., a file in the /etc directory). NOTE: this is unrelated to CMUSphinx.",
