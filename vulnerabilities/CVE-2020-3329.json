  "Description": "A vulnerability in role-based access control of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow a read-only authenticated, remote attacker to disable user accounts on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect allocation of the enable/disable action button under the role-based access control code on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a read-only user and then updating the roles of other users to disable them. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable users, including administrative users.",
