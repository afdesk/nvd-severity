  "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw in Linux kernel versions prior to 5.11 may be seen if sco_sock_getsockopt function in net/bluetooth/sco.c do not have a sanity check for a socket connection, when using BT_SNDMTU/BT_RCVMTU for SCO sockets. This could allow a local attacker with a special user privilege to crash the system (DOS) or leak kernel internal information.",
