  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the CasAuth extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.1. Due to improper username validation, it allowed user impersonation with trivial manipulations of certain characters within a given username. An ordinary user may be able to login as a \"bureaucrat user\" who has a similar username, as demonstrated by usernames that differ only in (1) bidirectional override symbols or (2) blank space.",
