  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation\n\nIn commit 599be01ee567 (\"net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex\")\nI moved cp->hash calculation before the first\ntcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp->alloc_hash is left untouched.\nThis difference could lead to another out of bound access.\n\ncp->alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we should\nupdate it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().",
