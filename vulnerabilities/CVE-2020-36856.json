  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to 5.6.14 contain an authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in the CCM command_test.php script. Insufficient validation of the `address` parameter allows an authenticated user with access to the Core Config Manager to inject shell metacharacters that are incorporated into backend command invocations. Successful exploitation enables arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the Nagios XI web application user and may be leveraged to execute commands on the underlying XI host, modify system configuration, or fully compromise the host.",
