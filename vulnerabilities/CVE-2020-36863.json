  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to\u00a05.7.2\u00a0allow PHP files to be uploaded to the Audio Import directory and executed from that location. The upload handler did not properly restrict file types or enforce storage outside of the webroot, and the web server permitted execution within the upload directory. An authenticated attacker with access to the audio import feature could upload a crafted PHP file and then request it to achieve remote code execution with the privileges of the application service.",
