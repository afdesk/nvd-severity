  "Description": "This affects the package find-my-way before 2.2.5, from 3.0.0 and before 3.0.5. It accepts the Accept-Version' header by default, and if versioned routes are not being used, this could lead to a denial of service. Accept-Version can be used as an unkeyed header in a cache poisoning attack.",
