  "Description": "A vulnerability in the API subsystem and in the web-management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data.\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-management interface and certain HTTP-based APIs do not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the affected system.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
