  "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementations for Cisco&nbsp;IP Phone Series 68xx/78xx/88xx could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP phone.\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to missing checks when the IP phone processes a Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP phone or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.Note: Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.",
