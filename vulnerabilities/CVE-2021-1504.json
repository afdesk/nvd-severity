These vulnerabilities are due to lack of proper input validation of the HTTPS request. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTPS request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability affects only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations. For more information, see the Vulnerable Products section.",
