  "Description": "A vulnerability in Ethernet over GRE (EoGRE) packet processing of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9800 Family Wireless Controller, Embedded Wireless Controller, and Embedded Wireless on Catalyst 9000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed EoGRE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
