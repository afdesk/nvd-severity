  "Description": "Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS by default. In case of error it falls back to a non-TLS URL http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.",
