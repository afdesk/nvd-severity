  "Description": "Potential for arbitrary code execution in npm package @thi.ng/egf `#gpg`-tagged property values (only if `decrypt: true` option is enabled). PR with patch has been submitted and will has been released as of v0.4.0 By default the EGF parse functions do NOT attempt to decrypt values (since GPG only available in non-browser env). However, if GPG encrypted values are used/required: 1. Perform a regex search for `#gpg`-tagged values in the EGF source file/string and check for backtick (\\`) chars in the encrypted value string 2. Replace/remove them or skip parsing if present.",
