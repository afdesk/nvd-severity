  "Description": "SAP Business Warehouse, versions 700, 701, 702, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 782 and SAP BW/4HANA, versions 100, 200, allow a low privileged attacker to inject code using a remote enabled function module over the network. Via the function module an attacker can create a malicious ABAP report which could be used to get access to sensitive data, to inject malicious UPDATE statements that could have also impact on the operating system, to disrupt the functionality of the SAP system which can thereby lead to a Denial of Service.",
