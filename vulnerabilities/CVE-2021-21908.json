  "Description": "Specially-crafted command line arguments can lead to arbitrary file deletion. The handle_delete function does not attempt to sanitize or otherwise validate the contents of the [file] parameter (passed to the function as argv[1]), allowing an authenticated attacker to supply directory traversal primitives and delete semi-arbitrary files.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
