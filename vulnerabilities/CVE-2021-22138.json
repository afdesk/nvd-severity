  "Description": "In Logstash versions after 6.4.0 and before 6.8.15 and 7.12.0 a TLS certificate validation flaw was found in the monitoring feature. When specifying a trusted server CA certificate Logstash would not properly verify the certificate returned by the monitoring server. This could result in a man in the middle style attack against the Logstash monitoring data.",
