  "Description": "Luxion KeyShot versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Viewer versions prior to 10.1, Luxion KeyShot Network Rendering versions prior to 10.1, and Luxion KeyVR versions prior to 10.1 are vulnerable to an attack because the .bip documents display a \u201cload\u201d command, which can be pointed to a .dll from a remote network share. As a result, the .dll entry point can be executed without sufficient UI warning.",
