  "Description": "Nextcloud server before 19.0.11, 20.0.10, 21.0.2 is vulnerable to brute force attacks due to lack of inclusion of IPv6 subnets in rate-limiting considerations. This could potentially result in an attacker bypassing rate-limit controls such as the Nextcloud brute-force protection.",
