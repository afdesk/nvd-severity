  "Description": "On all versions of BIG-IP 12.1.x and 11.6.x, the original TLS protocol includes a weakness in the master secret negotiation that is mitigated by the Extended Master Secret (EMS) extension defined in RFC 7627. TLS connections that do not use EMS are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks during renegotiation. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.",
