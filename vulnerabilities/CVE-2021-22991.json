  "Description": "On BIG-IP versions 16.0.x before 16.0.1.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.2.1, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, and 12.1.x before 12.1.5.3, undisclosed requests to a virtual server may be incorrectly handled by the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) URI normalization, which may trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in a DoS attack. In certain situations, it may theoretically allow bypass of URL based access control or remote code execution (RCE). Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.",
