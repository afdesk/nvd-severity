{
  "Description": "By passing invalid javascript code where await and yield were called upon non-async and non-generator getter/setter functions, Hermes would invoke generator functions and error out on invalid await/yield positions. This could result in segmentation fault as a consequence of type confusion error, with a low chance of RCE. This issue affects Hermes versions prior to v0.10.0.",
