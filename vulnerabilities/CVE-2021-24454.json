  "Description": "In the YOP Poll WordPress plugin before 6.2.8, when a pool is created with the options \"Allow other answers\", \"Display other answers in the result list\" and \"Show results\", it can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues as the 'Other' answer is not sanitised before being output in the page.
