  "Description": "The daac_delete_booking_callback function, hooked to the daac_delete_booking AJAX action, takes the id POST parameter which is passed into the SQL statement without proper sanitisation, validation or escaping, leading to a SQL Injection issue. Furthermore, the ajax action is lacking any CSRF and capability check, making it available to any authenticated user.",
