  "Description": "Nagios XI version xi-5.7.5 is affected by cross-site scripting (XSS). The vulnerability exists in the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/admin/sshterm.php due to improper sanitization of user-controlled input. A maliciously crafted URL, when clicked by an admin user, can be used to steal his/her session cookies or it can be chained with the previous bugs to get one-click remote command execution (RCE) on the Nagios XI server.",
