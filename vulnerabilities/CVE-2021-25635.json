  "Description": "An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed \nan attacker to self sign an ODF document, with a signature untrusted by \nthe target, then modify it to change the signature algorithm to an \ninvalid (or unknown to LibreOffice) algorithm and LibreOffice would incorrectly present such a signature with an unknown algorithm as a \nvalid signature issued by a trusted person\n\n\nThis issue affects LibreOffice: from 7.0 before 7.0.5, from 7.1 before 7.1.1.",
