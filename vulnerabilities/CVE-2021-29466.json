  "Description": "Discord-Recon is a bot for the Discord chat service. In versions of Discord-Recon 0.0.3 and prior, a remote attacker is able to read local files from the server that can disclose important information. As a workaround, a bot maintainer can locate the file `app.py` and add `.replace('..', '')` into the `Path` variable inside of the `recon` function. The vulnerability is patched in version 0.0.4.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
