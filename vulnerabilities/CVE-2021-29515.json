The implementation of `MatrixDiag*` operations(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4c4f420e68f1cfaf8f4b6e8e3eb857e9e4c3ff33/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L195-L197) does not validate that the tensor arguments are non-empty. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
