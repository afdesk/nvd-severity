  "Description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `MatrixTriangularSolve`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8cae746d8449c7dda5298327353d68613f16e798/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_triangular_solve_op_impl.h#L160-L240) fails to terminate kernel execution if one validation condition fails. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
