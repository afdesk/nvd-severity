  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Home Assistant before 2021.1.3 does not have a protection layer that can help to prevent directory-traversal attacks against custom integrations. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that the vulnerability itself is in custom integrations written by third parties, not in Home Assistant; however, Home Assistant does have a security update that is worthwhile in addressing this situation.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
