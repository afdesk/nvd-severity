  "Description": "Monitorix 3.13.0 allows remote attackers to bypass Basic Authentication in a default installation (i.e., an installation without a hosts_deny option). This issue occurred because a new access-control feature was introduced without considering that some exiting installations became unsafe, upon an update to 3.13.0, unless the new feature was immediately configured.",
