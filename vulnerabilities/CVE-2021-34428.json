  "Description": "For Eclipse Jetty versions <= 9.4.40, <= 10.0.2, <= 11.0.2, if an exception is thrown from the SessionListener#sessionDestroyed() method, then the session ID is not invalidated in the session ID manager. On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this can result in a session not being invalidated. This can result in an application used on a shared computer being left logged in.",
