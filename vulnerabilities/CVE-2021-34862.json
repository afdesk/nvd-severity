  "Description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-2020 1.01rc001 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the var:menu parameter provided to the webproc endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-13270.",
