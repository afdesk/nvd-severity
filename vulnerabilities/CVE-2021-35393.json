  "Description": "Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides a 'WiFi Simple Config' server that implements both UPnP and SSDP protocols. The binary is usually named wscd or mini_upnpd and is the successor to miniigd. The server is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that is present due to unsafe parsing of the UPnP SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE Callback header. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
