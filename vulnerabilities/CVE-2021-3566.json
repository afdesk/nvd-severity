  "Description": "Prior to ffmpeg version 4.3, the tty demuxer did not have a 'read_probe' function assigned to it. By crafting a legitimate \"ffconcat\" file that references an image, followed by a file the triggers the tty demuxer, the contents of the second file will be copied into the output file verbatim (as long as the `-vcodec copy` option is passed to ffmpeg).",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
