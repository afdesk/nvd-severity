  "Description": "An issue was discovered in HCC Embedded InterNiche NicheStack through 4.3. The tfshnd():tftpsrv.c TFTP packet processing function doesn't ensure that a filename is adequately '\\0' terminated; therefore, a subsequent call to strlen for the filename might read out of bounds of the protocol packet buffer (if no '\\0' byte exists within a reasonable range).",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
