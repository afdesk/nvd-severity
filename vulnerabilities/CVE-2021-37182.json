(All versions < V6.5). The OSPF protocol implementation in affected devices fails to verify the checksum and length fields in the OSPF LS Update messages. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause interruptions in the network by sending specially crafted OSPF packets. Successful exploitation requires OSPF to be enabled on an affected device.",
