  "Description": "Next.js is a React framework. Versions of Next.js between 10.0.0 and 11.0.0 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability. In order for an instance to be affected by the vulnerability, the `next.config.js` file must have `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default or the instance is deployed on Vercel, the instance is not affected by the vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in Next.js version 11.1.1.",
