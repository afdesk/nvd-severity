  "Description": "EnroCrypt is a Python module for encryption and hashing. Prior to version 1.1.4, EnroCrypt used the MD5 hashing algorithm in the hashing file. Beginners who are unfamiliar with hashes can face problems as MD5 is considered an insecure hashing algorithm. The vulnerability is patched in v1.1.4 of the product. As a workaround, users can remove the `MD5` hashing function from the file `hashing.py`.",
