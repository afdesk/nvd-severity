  "Description": "The Google Maps Easy WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/modules/marker_groups/views/tpl/mgrEditMarkerGroup.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.9.33. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
