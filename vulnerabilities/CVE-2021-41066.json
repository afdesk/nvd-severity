  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Listary through 6. When Listary is configured as admin, Listary will not ask for permissions again if a user tries to access files on the system from Listary itself (it will bypass UAC protection; there is no privilege validation of the current user that runs via Listary).",
  "Severity": "HIGH"
