  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference function for `Transpose` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. This occurs whenever `perm` contains negative elements. The shape inference function does not validate that the indices in `perm` are all valid. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
