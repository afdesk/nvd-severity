  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Contiki-NG tinyDTLS through master branch 53a0d97. An infinite loop bug exists during the handling of a ClientHello handshake message. This bug allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a malformed ClientHello handshake message with an odd length of cipher suites, which triggers an infinite loop (consuming all resources) and a buffer over-read that can disclose sensitive information.",
