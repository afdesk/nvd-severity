  "Description": "Web Sockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod methods which may be set, leading to a nil pointer dereference if the returned UserData pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass. This issue only affects WebSockets with an AuthenticateMethod hook. Request handlers that do not explicitly use WebSockets are not vulnerable.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
