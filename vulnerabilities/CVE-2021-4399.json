  "Description": "The Edwiser Bridge plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,2.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the user_data_synchronization_initiater(), course_synchronization_initiater(), users_link_to_moodle_synchronization(), connection_test_initiater(), admin_menus(), and subscribe_handler() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
