  "Description": "The Essential Addons for Elementor  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to and including 4.6.4 due to a lack of restrictions on who can add a registration form and a custom registration role to an Elementor created page. This makes it possible for attackers with access to the Elementor page builder to create a new registration form that defaults to the user role being set to administrator and subsequently register as an administrative user.",
