  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdkfd: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning\n\nIf get_num_sdma_queues or get_num_xgmi_sdma_queues is 0, we end up\ndoing a shift operation where the number of bits shifted equals\nnumber of bits in the operand. This behaviour is undefined.\n\nSet num_sdma_queues or num_xgmi_sdma_queues to ULLONG_MAX, if the\ncount is >= number of bits in the operand.\n\nBug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1472",
