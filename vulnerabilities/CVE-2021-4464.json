  "Description": "FiberHome AN5506-04-FA firmware versions up to and including RP2631 and HG6245D prior to RP2602 contain a stack-based buffer overflow, as the HTTP service ('webs') fails to enforce maximum lengths for Cookie header values. When a cookie longer than 511 bytes is processed, a stack buffer is overrun, leading to a crash or potential control of execution flow.",
