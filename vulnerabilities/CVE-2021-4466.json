  "Description": "IPCop versions up to and including 2.1.9 contain an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability within the web-based administration interface. The email configuration component inserts user-controlled values, including the EMAIL_PW parameter, directly into system-level operations without proper input sanitation. By modifying the email password field to include shell metacharacters and issuing a save-and-test-mail action, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web interface, resulting in full system compromise.",
