  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SICAM PQ Analyzer (All versions < V3.18). A service is started by an unquoted registry entry. As there are spaces in this path, attackers with write privilege to those directories might be able to plant executables that will run in place of the legitimate process. Attackers might achieve persistence on the system (\"backdoors\") or cause a denial of service.",
