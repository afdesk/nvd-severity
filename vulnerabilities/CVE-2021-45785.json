  "Description": "TruDesk Help Desk/Ticketing Solution v1.1.11 is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack which would allow an attacker to restart the server, causing a DoS attack. The attacker must craft a webpage that would perform a GET request to the /api/v1/admin/restart endpoint, then the victim (who has sufficient privileges), would visit the page and the server restart would begin. The attacker must know the full URL that TruDesk is on in order to craft the webpage.",
