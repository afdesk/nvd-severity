  "Description": "The giftrans function in giftrans 1.12.2 contains a stack-based buffer overflow because a value inside the input file determines the amount of data to write. This allows an attacker to overwrite up to 250 bytes outside of the allocated buffer with arbitrary data.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
