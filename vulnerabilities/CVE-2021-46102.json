  "Description": "From version 0.2.14 to 0.2.16 for Solana rBPF, function \"relocate\" in the file src/elf.rs has an integer overflow bug because the sym.st_value is read directly from ELF file without checking. If the sym.st_value is rather large, an integer overflow is triggered while calculating the variable \"addr\" via \"addr = (sym.st_value + refd_pa) as u64\";",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM"
