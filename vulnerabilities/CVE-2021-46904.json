  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration\n\nMultiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double\nunregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds\nbut the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.\n\nThe get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number\nbut doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller\nlater. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()\nwould return the same minor number.\n\nFix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number\nimmediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor()\nto better reflect what it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index()\nto release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the\ngiven hso_serial. Every obtain_minor() should have corresponding\nrelease_minor() call.",
