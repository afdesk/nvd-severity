  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nixgbe: fix unbalanced device enable/disable in suspend/resume\n\npci_disable_device() called in __ixgbe_shutdown() decreases\ndev->enable_cnt by 1. pci_enable_device_mem() which increases\ndev->enable_cnt by 1, was removed from ixgbe_resume() in commit\n6f82b2558735 (\"ixgbe: use generic power management\"). This caused\nunbalanced increase/decrease. So add pci_enable_device_mem() back.\n\nFix the following call trace.\n\n  ixgbe 0000:17:00.1: disabling already-disabled device\n  Call Trace:\n   __ixgbe_shutdown+0x10a/0x1e0 [ixgbe]\n   ixgbe_suspend+0x32/0x70 [ixgbe]\n   pci_pm_suspend+0x87/0x160\n   ? pci_pm_freeze+0xd0/0xd0\n   dpm_run_callback+0x42/0x170\n   __device_suspend+0x114/0x460\n   async_suspend+0x1f/0xa0\n   async_run_entry_fn+0x3c/0xf0\n   process_one_work+0x1dd/0x410\n   worker_thread+0x34/0x3f0\n   ? cancel_delayed_work+0x90/0x90\n   kthread+0x14c/0x170\n   ? kthread_park+0x90/0x90\n   ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30",
