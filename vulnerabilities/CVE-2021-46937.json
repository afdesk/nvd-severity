  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/dbgfs: fix 'struct pid' leaks in 'dbgfs_target_ids_write()'\n\nDAMON debugfs interface increases the reference counts of 'struct pid's\nfor targets from the 'target_ids' file write callback\n('dbgfs_target_ids_write()'), but decreases the counts only in DAMON\nmonitoring termination callback ('dbgfs_before_terminate()').\n\nTherefore, when 'target_ids' file is repeatedly written without DAMON\nmonitoring start/termination, the reference count is not decreased and\ntherefore memory for the 'struct pid' cannot be freed.  This commit\nfixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids' is\nwritten.",
