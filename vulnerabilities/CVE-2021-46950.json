  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid1: properly indicate failure when ending a failed write request\n\nThis patch addresses a data corruption bug in raid1 arrays using bitmaps.\nWithout this fix, the bitmap bits for the failed I/O end up being cleared.\n\nSince we are in the failure leg of raid1_end_write_request, the request\neither needs to be retried (R1BIO_WriteError) or failed (R1BIO_Degraded).",
