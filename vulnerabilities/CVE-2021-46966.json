If the requested count is less than table.length, the\nallocated buffer will be freed but subsequent calls to cm_write() will\nstill try to access it.\n\nRemove the unconditional kfree(buf) at the end of the function and\nset the buf to NULL in the -EINVAL error path to match the rest of\nfunction.",
