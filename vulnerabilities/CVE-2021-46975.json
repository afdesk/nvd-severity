  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: conntrack: Make global sysctls readonly in non-init netns\n\nThese sysctls point to global variables:\n- NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX (&nf_conntrack_max)\n- NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX (&nf_ct_expect_max)\n- NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS (&nf_conntrack_htable_size_user)\n\nBecause their data pointers are not updated to point to per-netns\nstructures, they must be marked read-only in a non-init_net ns.\nOtherwise, changes in any net namespace are reflected in (leaked into)\nall other net namespaces. This problem has existed since the\nintroduction of net namespaces.\n\nThe current logic marks them read-only only if the net namespace is\nowned by an unprivileged user (other than init_user_ns).\n\nCommit d0febd81ae77 (\"netfilter: conntrack: re-visit sysctls in\nunprivileged namespaces\") \"exposes all sysctls even if the namespace is\nunpriviliged.\" Since we need to mark them readonly in any case, we can\nforego the unprivileged user check altogether.",
