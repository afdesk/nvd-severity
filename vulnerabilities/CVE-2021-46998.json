  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethernet:enic: Fix a use after free bug in enic_hard_start_xmit\n\nIn enic_hard_start_xmit, it calls enic_queue_wq_skb(). Inside\nenic_queue_wq_skb, if some error happens, the skb will be freed\nby dev_kfree_skb(skb). But the freed skb is still used in\nskb_tx_timestamp(skb).\n\nMy patch makes enic_queue_wq_skb() return error and goto spin_unlock()\nincase of error. The solution is provided by Govind.\nSee https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/30/961.",
