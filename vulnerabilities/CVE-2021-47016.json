  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nm68k: mvme147,mvme16x: Don't wipe PCC timer config bits\n\nDon't clear the timer 1 configuration bits when clearing the interrupt flag\nand counter overflow. As Michael reported, \"This results in no timer\ninterrupts being delivered after the first. Initialization then hangs\nin calibrate_delay as the jiffies counter is not updated.\"\n\nOn mvme16x, enable the timer after requesting the irq, consistent with\nmvme147.",
