  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nath10k: Fix a use after free in ath10k_htc_send_bundle\n\nIn ath10k_htc_send_bundle, the bundle_skb could be freed by\ndev_kfree_skb_any(bundle_skb). But the bundle_skb is used later\nby bundle_skb->len.\n\nAs skb_len = bundle_skb->len, my patch replaces bundle_skb->len to\nskb_len after the bundle_skb was freed.",
