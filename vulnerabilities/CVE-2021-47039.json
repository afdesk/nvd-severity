  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nataflop: potential out of bounds in do_format()\n\nThe function uses \"type\" as an array index:\n\n\tq = unit[drive].disk[type]->queue;\n\nUnfortunately the bounds check on \"type\" isn't done until later in the\nfunction.  Fix this by moving the bounds check to the start.",
