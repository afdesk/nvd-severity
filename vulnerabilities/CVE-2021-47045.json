  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference in lpfc_prep_els_iocb()\n\nIt is possible to call lpfc_issue_els_plogi() passing a did for which no\nmatching ndlp is found. A call is then made to lpfc_prep_els_iocb() with a\nnull pointer to a lpfc_nodelist structure resulting in a null pointer\ndereference.\n\nFix by returning an error status if no valid ndlp is found. Fix up comments\nregarding ndlp reference counting.",
