  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix use-after-free in zynqmp_qspi_exec_op\n\nWhen handling op->addr, it is using the buffer \"tmpbuf\" which has been\nfreed. This will trigger a use-after-free KASAN warning. Let's use\ntemporary variables to store op->addr.val and op->cmd.opcode to fix\nthis issue.",
