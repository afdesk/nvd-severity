  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmtd: require write permissions for locking and badblock ioctls\n\nMEMLOCK, MEMUNLOCK and OTPLOCK modify protection bits. Thus require\nwrite permission. Depending on the hardware MEMLOCK might even be\nwrite-once, e.g. for SPI-NOR flashes with their WP# tied to GND. OTPLOCK\nis always write-once.\n\nMEMSETBADBLOCK modifies the bad block table.",
