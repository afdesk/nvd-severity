  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations\n\nCommit b50aa49638c7 (\"hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer underflows of\ntemperature calculations\") addressed a number of underflow situations\nwhen writing temperature limits. However, it missed one situation, seen\nwhen an attempt is made to set the hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the\ncritical temperature limit is negative.\n\nUse clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to ensure that\nthe provided value can never overflow or underflow.",
