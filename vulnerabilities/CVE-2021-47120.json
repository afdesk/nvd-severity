  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect\n\nCommit 9d7b18668956 (\"HID: magicmouse: add support for Apple Magic\nTrackpad 2\") added a sanity check for an Apple trackpad but returned\nsuccess instead of -ENODEV when the check failed. This means that the\nremove callback will dereference the never-initialised driver data\npointer when the driver is later unbound (e.g. on USB disconnect).",
