  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/smc: remove device from smcd_dev_list after failed device_add()\n\nIf the device_add() for a smcd_dev fails, there's no cleanup step that\nrolls back the earlier list_add(). The device subsequently gets freed,\nand we end up with a corrupted list.\n\nAdd some error handling that removes the device from the list.",
