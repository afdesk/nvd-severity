  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntipc: wait and exit until all work queues are done\n\nOn some host, a crash could be triggered simply by repeating these\ncommands several times:\n\n  # modprobe tipc\n  # tipc bearer enable media udp name UDP1 localip 127.0.0.1\n  # rmmod tipc\n\n  [] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffc096bb00\n  [] Workqueue: events 0xffffffffc096bb00\n  [] Call Trace:\n  []  ? process_one_work+0x1a7/0x360\n  []  ? worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  []  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  []  ? kthread+0x116/0x130\n  []  ? kthread_flush_work_fn+0x10/0x10\n  []  ? ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40\n\nWhen removing the TIPC module, the UDP tunnel sock will be delayed to\nrelease in a work queue as sock_release() can't be done in rtnl_lock().\nIf the work queue is schedule to run after the TIPC module is removed,\nkernel will crash as the work queue function cleanup_beareri() code no\nlonger exists when trying to invoke it.\n\nTo fix it, this patch introduce a member wq_count in tipc_net to track\nthe numbers of work queues in schedule, and  wait and exit until all\nwork queues are done in tipc_exit_net().",
