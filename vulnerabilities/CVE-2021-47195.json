  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: fix use-after-free of the add_lock mutex\n\nCommit 6098475d4cb4 (\"spi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on\nSPI buses\") introduced a per-controller mutex. But mutex_unlock() of\nsaid lock is called after the controller is already freed:\n\n  spi_unregister_controller(ctlr)\n  -> put_device(&ctlr->dev)\n    -> spi_controller_release(dev)\n  -> mutex_unlock(&ctrl->add_lock)\n\nMove the put_device() after the mutex_unlock().",
