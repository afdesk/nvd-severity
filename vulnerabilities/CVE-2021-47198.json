  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Fix use-after-free in lpfc_unreg_rpi() routine\n\nAn error is detected with the following report when unloading the driver:\n  \"KASAN: use-after-free in lpfc_unreg_rpi+0x1b1b\"\n\nThe NLP_REG_LOGIN_SEND nlp_flag is set in lpfc_reg_fab_ctrl_node(), but the\nflag is not cleared upon completion of the login.\n\nThis allows a second call to lpfc_unreg_rpi() to proceed with nlp_rpi set\nto LPFC_RPI_ALLOW_ERROR.  This results in a use after free access when used\nas an rpi_ids array index.\n\nFix by clearing the NLP_REG_LOGIN_SEND nlp_flag in\nlpfc_mbx_cmpl_fc_reg_login().",
