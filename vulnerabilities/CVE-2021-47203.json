  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Fix list_add() corruption in lpfc_drain_txq()\n\nWhen parsing the txq list in lpfc_drain_txq(), the driver attempts to pass\nthe requests to the adapter. If such an attempt fails, a local \"fail_msg\"\nstring is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to a\ncompletions list for cancellation.\n\nProcessing of any further jobs from the txq list continues, but since\n\"fail_msg\" remains set, jobs are added to the completions list regardless\nof whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added to\ntxcmplq, jobs are added to both lists resulting in list corruption.\n\nFix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completions\nlist. This stops the subsequent jobs from being added to the completions\nlist unless they had an appropriate failure.",
