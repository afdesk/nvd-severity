  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ll_temac: Make sure to free skb when it is completely used\n\nWith the skb pointer piggy-backed on the TX BD, we have a simple and\nefficient way to free the skb buffer when the frame has been transmitted.\nBut in order to avoid freeing the skb while there are still fragments from\nthe skb in use, we need to piggy-back on the TX BD of the skb, not the\nfirst.\n\nWithout this, we are doing use-after-free on the DMA side, when the first\nBD of a multi TX BD packet is seen as completed in xmit_done, and the\nremaining BDs are still being processed.",
