  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: qrtr: fix OOB Read in qrtr_endpoint_post\n\nSyzbot reported slab-out-of-bounds Read in\nqrtr_endpoint_post. The problem was in wrong\n_size_ type:\n\n\tif (len != ALIGN(size, 4) + hdrlen)\n\t\tgoto err;\n\nIf size from qrtr_hdr is 4294967293 (0xfffffffd), the result of\nALIGN(size, 4) will be 0. In case of len == hdrlen and size == 4294967293\nin header this check won't fail and\n\n\tskb_put_data(skb, data + hdrlen, size);\n\nwill read out of bound from data, which is hdrlen allocated block.",
