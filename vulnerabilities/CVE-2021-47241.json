  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: strset: fix message length calculation\n\nOuter nest for ETHTOOL_A_STRSET_STRINGSETS is not accounted for.\nThis may result in ETHTOOL_MSG_STRSET_GET producing a warning like:\n\n    calculated message payload length (684) not sufficient\n    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 30967 at net/ethtool/netlink.c:369 ethnl_default_doit+0x87a/0xa20\n\nand a splat.\n\nAs usually with such warnings three conditions must be met for the warning\nto trigger:\n - there must be no skb size rounding up (e.g. reply_size of 684);\n - string set must be per-device (so that the header gets populated);\n - the device name must be at least 12 characters long.\n\nall in all with current user space it looks like reading priv flags\nis the only place this could potentially happen. Or with syzbot :)",
