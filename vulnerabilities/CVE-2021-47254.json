  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Fix use-after-free in gfs2_glock_shrink_scan\n\nThe GLF_LRU flag is checked under lru_lock in gfs2_glock_remove_from_lru() to\nremove the glock from the lru list in __gfs2_glock_put().\n\nOn the shrink scan path, the same flag is cleared under lru_lock but because\nof cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) in gfs2_dispose_glock_lru(), progress on the\nput side can be made without deleting the glock from the lru list.\n\nKeep GLF_LRU across the race window opened by cond_resched_lock(&lru_lock) to\nensure correct behavior on both sides - clear GLF_LRU after list_del under\nlru_lock.",
