  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: fix another slab-out-of-bounds in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions\n\nWhile running the self-tests on a KASAN enabled kernel, I observed a\nslab-out-of-bounds splat very similar to the one reported in\ncommit 821bbf79fe46 (\"ipv6: Fix KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in\n fib6_nh_flush_exceptions\").\n\nWe additionally need to take care of fib6_metrics initialization\nfailure when the caller provides an nh.\n\nThe fix is similar, explicitly free the route instead of calling\nfib6_info_release on a half-initialized object.",
