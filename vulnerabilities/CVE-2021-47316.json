  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix NULL dereference in nfs3svc_encode_getaclres\n\nIn error cases the dentry may be NULL.\n\nBefore 20798dfe249a, the encoder also checked dentry and\nd_really_is_positive(dentry), but that looks like overkill to me--zero\nstatus should be enough to guarantee a positive dentry.\n\nThis isn't the first time we've seen an error-case NULL dereference\nhidden in the initialization of a local variable in an xdr encoder.  But\nI went back through the other recent rewrites and didn't spot any\nsimilar bugs.",
