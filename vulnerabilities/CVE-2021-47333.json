  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge\n\nThere is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.\nA device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,\nbus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL.\nSince alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's\nASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later by\nalcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do\nhere is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.\nThis will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply\nreturn when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.\n\n[    1.246492] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000c0\n[    1.248731] RIP: 0010:pci_read_config_byte+0x5/0x40\n[    1.253998] Call Trace:\n[    1.254131]  ? alcor_pci_find_cap_offset.isra.0+0x3a/0x100 [alcor_pci]\n[    1.254476]  alcor_pci_probe+0x169/0x2d5 [alcor_pci]",
