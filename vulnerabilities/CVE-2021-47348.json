  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Avoid HDCP over-read and corruption\n\nInstead of reading the desired 5 bytes of the actual target field,\nthe code was reading 8. This could result in a corrupted value if the\ntrailing 3 bytes were non-zero, so instead use an appropriately sized\nand zero-initialized bounce buffer, and read only 5 bytes before casting\nto u64.",
