  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinder: make sure fd closes complete\n\nDuring BC_FREE_BUFFER processing, the BINDER_TYPE_FDA object\ncleanup may close 1 or more fds. The close operations are\ncompleted using the task work mechanism -- which means the thread\nneeds to return to userspace or the file object may never be\ndereferenced -- which can lead to hung processes.\n\nForce the binder thread back to userspace if an fd is closed during\nBC_FREE_BUFFER handling.",
