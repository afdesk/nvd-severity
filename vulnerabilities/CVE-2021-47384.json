  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (w83793) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structure field\n\nIf driver read tmp value sufficient for\n(tmp & 0x08) && (!(tmp & 0x80)) && ((tmp & 0x7) == ((tmp >> 4) & 0x7))\nfrom device then Null pointer dereference occurs.\n(It is possible if tmp = 0b0xyz1xyz, where same literals mean same numbers)\nAlso lm75[] does not serve a purpose anymore after switching to\ndevm_i2c_new_dummy_device() in w83791d_detect_subclients().\n\nThe patch fixes possible NULL pointer dereference by removing lm75[].\n\nFound by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).\n\n[groeck: Dropped unnecessary continuation lines, fixed multi-line alignments]",
