  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipack: ipoctal: fix stack information leak\n\nThe tty driver name is used also after registering the driver and must\nspecifically not be allocated on the stack to avoid leaking information\nto user space (or triggering an oops).\n\nDrivers should not try to encode topology information in the tty device\nname but this one snuck in through staging without anyone noticing and\nanother driver has since copied this malpractice.\n\nFixing the ABI is a separate issue, but this at least plugs the security\nhole.",
