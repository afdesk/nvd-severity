  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: iscsi: Fix iscsi_task use after free\n\nCommit d39df158518c (\"scsi: iscsi: Have abort handler get ref to conn\")\nadded iscsi_get_conn()/iscsi_put_conn() calls during abort handling but\nthen also changed the handling of the case where we detect an already\ncompleted task where we now end up doing a goto to the common put/cleanup\ncode. This results in a iscsi_task use after free, because the common\ncleanup code will do a put on the iscsi_task.\n\nThis reverts the goto and moves the iscsi_get_conn() to after we've checked\nif the iscsi_task is valid.",
