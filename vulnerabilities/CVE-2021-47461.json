  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuserfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit_mmap()\n\nA race is possible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by\nexit_mmap() and at the same time userfaultfd_writeprotect() is called.\n\nThe race was detected by KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears\nto be possible on vanilla kernels as well.\n\nUse mmget_not_zero() to prevent the race as done in other userfaultfd\noperations.",
