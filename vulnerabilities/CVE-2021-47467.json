  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkunit: fix reference count leak in kfree_at_end\n\nThe reference counting issue happens in the normal path of\nkfree_at_end(). When kunit_alloc_and_get_resource() is invoked, the\nfunction forgets to handle the returned resource object, whose refcount\nincreased inside, causing a refcount leak.\n\nFix this issue by calling kunit_alloc_resource() instead of\nkunit_alloc_and_get_resource().\n\nFixed the following when applying:\nShuah Khan <skhan@linuxfoundation.org>\n\nCHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis\n+\tkunit_alloc_resource(test, NULL, kfree_res_free, GFP_KERNEL,\n \t\t\t\t     (void *)to_free);",
