  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses\n\nCurrently we have a global spi_add_lock which we take when adding new\ndevices so that we can check that we're not trying to reuse a chip\nselect that's already controlled.  This means that if the SPI device is\nitself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI\ndevices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate\nthose devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller\nand hence already holding the global spi_add_lock.  Since we only care\nabout concurrency within a single SPI bus move the lock to be per\ncontroller, avoiding the deadlock.\n\nThis can be easily triggered in the case of spi-mux.",
