  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm, slub: fix potential use-after-free in slab_debugfs_fops\n\nWhen sysfs_slab_add failed, we shouldn't call debugfs_slab_add() for s\nbecause s will be freed soon.  And slab_debugfs_fops will use s later\nleading to a use-after-free.",
