  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm: mxsfb: Fix NULL pointer dereference crash on unload\n\nThe mxsfb->crtc.funcs may already be NULL when unloading the driver,\nin which case calling mxsfb_irq_disable() via drm_irq_uninstall() from\nmxsfb_unload() leads to NULL pointer dereference.\n\nSince all we care about is masking the IRQ and mxsfb->base is still\nvalid, just use that to clear and mask the IRQ.",
