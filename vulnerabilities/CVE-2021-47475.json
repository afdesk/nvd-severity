  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows\n\nThe driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until\nrecently had no sanity checks on the sizes.\n\nCommit e1f13c879a7c (\"staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize\nof usb endpoints found\") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences\nwhen accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a\nzero wMaxPacketSize.\n\nMake sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other\naccesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in\nvmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond\nthe buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.\n\nThe original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.\nSupport was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is\npresumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.",
