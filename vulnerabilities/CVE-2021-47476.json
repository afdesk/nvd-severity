  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: ni_usb6501: fix NULL-deref in command paths\n\nThe driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but had no sanity\nchecks on the sizes. This can lead to zero-size-pointer dereferences or\noverflowed transfer buffers in ni6501_port_command() and\nni6501_counter_command() if a (malicious) device has smaller max-packet\nsizes than expected (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).\n\nAdd the missing sanity checks to probe().",
