  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv, bpf: Fix potential NULL dereference\n\nThe bpf_jit_binary_free() function requires a non-NULL argument. When\nthe RISC-V BPF JIT fails to converge in NR_JIT_ITERATIONS steps,\njit_data->header will be NULL, which triggers a NULL\ndereference. Avoid this by checking the argument, prior calling the\nfunction.",
