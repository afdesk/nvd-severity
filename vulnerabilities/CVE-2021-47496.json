  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/tls: Fix flipped sign in tls_err_abort() calls\n\nsk->sk_err appears to expect a positive value, a convention that ktls\ndoesn't always follow and that leads to memory corruption in other code.\nFor instance,\n\n    [kworker]\n    tls_encrypt_done(..., err=<negative error from crypto request>)\n      tls_err_abort(.., err)\n        sk->sk_err = err;\n\n    [task]\n    splice_from_pipe_feed\n      ...\n        tls_sw_do_sendpage\n          if (sk->sk_err) {\n            ret = -sk->sk_err;  // ret is positive\n\n    splice_from_pipe_feed (continued)\n      ret = actor(...)  // ret is still positive and interpreted as bytes\n                        // written, resulting in underflow of buf->len and\n                        // sd->len, leading to huge buf->offset and bogus\n                        // addresses computed in later calls to actor()\n\nFix all tls_err_abort() callers to pass a negative error code\nconsistently and centralize the error-prone sign flip there, throwing in\na warning to catch future misuse and uninlining the function so it\nreally does only warn once.",
