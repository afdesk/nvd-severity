  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: m_can: m_can_read_fifo: fix memory leak in error branch\n\nIn m_can_read_fifo(), if the second call to m_can_fifo_read() fails,\nthe function jump to the out_fail label and returns without calling\nm_can_receive_skb(). This means that the skb previously allocated by\nalloc_can_skb() is not freed. In other terms, this is a memory leak.\n\nThis patch adds a goto label to destroy the skb if an error occurs.\n\nIssue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for\ndetails.",
