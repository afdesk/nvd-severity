  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vc4: kms: Add missing drm_crtc_commit_put\n\nCommit 9ec03d7f1ed3 (\"drm/vc4: kms: Wait on previous FIFO users before a\ncommit\") introduced a global state for the HVS, with each FIFO storing\nthe current CRTC commit so that we can properly synchronize commits.\n\nHowever, the refcounting was off and we thus ended up leaking the\ndrm_crtc_commit structure every commit. Add a drm_crtc_commit_put to\nprevent the leakage.",
