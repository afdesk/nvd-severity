  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: vlan: fix underflow for the real_dev refcnt\n\nInject error before dev_hold(real_dev) in register_vlan_dev(),\nand execute the following testcase:\n\nip link add dev dummy1 type dummy\nip link add name dummy1.100 link dummy1 type vlan id 100\nip link del dev dummy1\n\nWhen the dummy netdevice is removed, we will get a WARNING as following:\n\n=======================================================================\nrefcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.\nWARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at lib/refcount.c:31 refcount_warn_saturate+0xbf/0x1e0\n\nand an endless loop of:\n\n=======================================================================\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count = -1073741824\n\nThat is because dev_put(real_dev) in vlan_dev_free() be called without\ndev_hold(real_dev) in register_vlan_dev(). It makes the refcnt of real_dev\nunderflow.\n\nMove the dev_hold(real_dev) to vlan_dev_init() which is the call-back of\nndo_init(). That makes dev_hold() and dev_put() for vlan's real_dev\nsymmetrical.",
