  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets\n\nThe mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being set correctly:\nIt prevents setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_ULP, \"mptcp\", 6); from\nworking for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).\n\nBut in case of fallback, accept() can return a plain tcp sk.\nIn such case, sk is still tagged as 'kernel' and setsockopt will work.\n\nThis will crash the kernel, The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn\nmptcp socket:\n\nBUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in subflow_data_ready+0x181/0x2b0\nCall Trace:\n tcp_data_ready+0xf8/0x370\n [..]",
