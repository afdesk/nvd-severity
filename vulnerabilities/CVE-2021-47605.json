  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvduse: fix memory corruption in vduse_dev_ioctl()\n\nThe \"config.offset\" comes from the user.  There needs to a check to\nprevent it being out of bounds.  The \"config.offset\" and\n\"dev->config_size\" variables are both type u32.  So if the offset if\nout of bounds then the \"dev->config_size - config.offset\" subtraction\nresults in a very high u32 value.  The out of bounds offset can result\nin memory corruption.",
