  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudmabuf: validate ubuf->pagecount\n\nSyzbot has reported GPF in sg_alloc_append_table_from_pages(). The\nproblem was in ubuf->pages == ZERO_PTR.\n\nubuf->pagecount is calculated from arguments passed from user-space. If\nuser creates udmabuf with list.size == 0 then ubuf->pagecount will be\nalso equal to zero; it causes kmalloc_array() to return ZERO_PTR.\n\nFix it by validating ubuf->pagecount before passing it to\nkmalloc_array().",
