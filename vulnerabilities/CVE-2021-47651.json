  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoc: qcom: rpmpd: Check for null return of devm_kcalloc\n\nBecause of the possible failure of the allocation, data->domains might\nbe NULL pointer and will cause the dereference of the NULL pointer\nlater.\nTherefore, it might be better to check it and directly return -ENOMEM\nwithout releasing data manually if fails, because the comment of the\ndevm_kmalloc() says \"Memory allocated with this function is\nautomatically freed on driver detach.\".",
