  "Description": "The WP Import Export WordPress plugin (both free and premium versions) is vulnerable to unauthenticated sensitive data disclosure due to a missing capability check on the download function wpie_process_file_download found in the ~/includes/classes/class-wpie-general.php file. This made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download any imported or exported information from a vulnerable site which can contain sensitive information like user data. This affects versions up to, and including, 3.9.15.",
