  "Description": "A flaw was found in the copying tool `nbdcopy` of libnbd. When performing multi-threaded copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly treating the completion of an asynchronous command as successful, rather than checking the *error parameter. This could result in the silent creation of a corrupted destination image.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
