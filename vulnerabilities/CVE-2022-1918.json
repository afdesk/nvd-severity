  "Description": "The ToolBar to Share plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_toolbar_comparte page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
