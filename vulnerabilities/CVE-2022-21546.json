  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: Fix WRITE_SAME No Data Buffer crash\n\nIn newer version of the SBC specs, we have a NDOB bit that indicates there\nis no data buffer that gets written out. If this bit is set using commands\nlike \"sg_write_same --ndob\" we will crash in target_core_iblock/file's\nexecute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg\nbecause its NULL.\n\nThis patch adds a check for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME code\nbecause we don't support it. And, it adds a check for zero SG elements in\neach handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal WRITE SAME with\nno data buffer.",
