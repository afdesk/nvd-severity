  "Description": "In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the name of a created Tag. Since the Tag name is not being sanitized properly in the edit tag page, a low privileged attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the Tag. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, and privileges escalation.",
