  "Description": "ToolJet versions v0.5.0 to v1.2.2 are vulnerable to token leakage via Referer header that leads to account takeover . If the user opens the invite link/signup link and then clicks on any external links within the page, it leaks the password set token/signup token in the referer header. Using these tokens the attacker can access the user\u2019s account.",
