  "Description": "Plaintext Storage of a Password vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 versions 4.04E (10.95.210.01) and prior and ICONICS GENESIS64 versions 10.90 to 10.97 allows a local authenticated attacker to gain authentication information and to access the database illegally. This is because when configuration information of GridWorX, a database linkage function of GENESIS64 and MC Works64, is exported to a CSV file, the authentication information is saved in plaintext, and an attacker who can access this CSV file can gain the authentication information.",
