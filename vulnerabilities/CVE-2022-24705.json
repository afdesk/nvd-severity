  "Description": "The rad_packet_recv function in radius/packet.c suffers from a memcpy buffer overflow, resulting in an overly-large recvfrom into a fixed buffer that causes a buffer overflow and overwrites arbitrary memory. If the server connects with a malicious client, crafted client requests can remotely trigger this vulnerability.",
