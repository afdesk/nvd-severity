  "Description": "flask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session. In versions prior to 1.2.1, he `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting an having an empty form). If implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed. Version 1.2.1 fixes the issue. Users can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. Checking the return value less explicitly should still work.",
