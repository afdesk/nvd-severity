  "Description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. The Symfony HTTP cache system, acts as a reverse proxy: It caches entire responses (including headers) and returns them to the clients. In a recent change in the `AbstractSessionListener`, the response might contain a `Set-Cookie` header. If the Symfony HTTP cache system is enabled, this response might bill stored and return to the next clients. An attacker can use this vulnerability to retrieve the victim's session. This issue has been patched and is available for branch 4.4.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
