  "Description": "SAS Web Report Studio 4.4 allows XSS. /SASWebReportStudio/logonAndRender.do has two parameters: saspfs_request_backlabel_list and saspfs_request_backurl_list. The first one affects the content of the button placed in the top left. The second affects the page to which the user is directed after pressing the button, e.g., a malicious web page. In addition, the second parameter executes JavaScript, which means XSS is possible by adding a javascript: URL.",
