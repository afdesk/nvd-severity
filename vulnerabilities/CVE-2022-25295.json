  "Description": "This affects the package github.com/gophish/gophish before 0.12.0. The Open Redirect vulnerability exists in the next query parameter. The application uses url.Parse(r.FormValue(\"next\")) to extract path and eventually redirect user to a relative URL, but if next parameter starts with multiple backslashes like \\\\\\\\\\\\example.com, browser will redirect user to http://example.com.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
