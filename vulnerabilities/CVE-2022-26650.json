  "Description": "In Apache ShenYui, ShenYu-Bootstrap, RegexPredicateJudge.java uses Pattern.matches(conditionData.getParamValue(), realData) to make judgments, where both parameters are controllable by the user. This can cause an attacker pass in malicious regular expressions and characters causing a resource exhaustion. This issue affects Apache ShenYu (incubating) 2.4.0, 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 and is fixed in 2.4.3.",
