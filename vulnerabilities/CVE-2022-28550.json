  "Description": "Matthias-Wandel/jhead jhead 3.06 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via shellescape(), jhead.c, jhead. jhead copies strings to a stack buffer when it detects a &i or &o. However, jhead does not check the boundary of the stack buffer. As a result, there will be a stack buffer overflow problem when multiple `&i` or `&o` are given.",
