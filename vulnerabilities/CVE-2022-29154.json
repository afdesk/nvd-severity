  "Description": "An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
