  "Description": "Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. In versions of gogs prior to 0.12.9 `DisplayName` does not filter characters input from users, which leads to an XSS vulnerability when directly displayed in the issue list. This issue has been resolved in commit 155cae1d which sanitizes `DisplayName` prior to display to the user. All users of gogs are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check their users' display names for malicious characters.",
