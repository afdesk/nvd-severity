  "Description": "KubeEdge is built upon Kubernetes and extends native containerized application orchestration and device management to hosts at the Edge. In affected versions a malicious message response from KubeEdge can crash the CSI Driver controller server by triggering a nil-pointer dereference panic. As a consequence, the CSI Driver controller will be in denial of service. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. At the time of writing, no workaround exists.",
