  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Building X - Security Manager Edge Controller (ACC-AP) (All versions). Affected devices do not properly check the integrity of firmware updates. This could allow a local attacker to upload a maliciously modified firmware onto the device. In a second scenario, a remote attacker who is able to intercept the transfer of a valid firmware from the server to the device could modify the firmware \"on the fly\".",
