  "Description": "It was possible to bypass Lock WARP switch feature https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/warp-settings/#lock-warp-switch on the WARP iOS mobile client by enabling both \"Disable for cellular networks\" and \"Disable for Wi-Fi networks\" switches at once in the application settings. Such configuration caused the WARP client to disconnect and allowed the user to bypass restrictions and policies enforced by the Zero Trust platform.",
