  "Description": "An out-of-bounds read in the rewrite function at /modules/caddyhttp/rewrite/rewrite.go in Caddy v2.5.1 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted URI. Note: This has been disputed as a bug, not a security vulnerability, in the Caddy web server that emerged when an administrator's bad configuration containing a malformed request URI caused the server to return an empty reply instead of a valid HTTP response to the client.",
