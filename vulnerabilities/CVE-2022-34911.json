  "Description": "An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.7, 1.36.x and 1.37.x before 1.37.3, and 1.38.x before 1.38.1. XSS can occur in configurations that allow a JavaScript payload in a username. After account creation, when it sets the page title to \"Welcome\" followed by the username, the username is not escaped: SpecialCreateAccount::successfulAction() calls ::showSuccessPage() with a message as second parameter, and OutputPage::setPageTitle() uses text().",
