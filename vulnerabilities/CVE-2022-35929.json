  "Description": "cosign is a container signing and verification utility. In versions prior to 1.10.1 cosign can report a false positive if any attestation exists. `cosign verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification when there is at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\"). This can happen when signing with a standard keypair and with \"keyless\" signing with Fulcio. This vulnerability can be reproduced with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2` image. This image has a `vuln` attestation but not an `spdx` attestation. However, if you run `cosign verify-attestation --type=spdx` on this image, it incorrectly succeeds. This issue has been addressed in version 1.10.1 of cosign. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
