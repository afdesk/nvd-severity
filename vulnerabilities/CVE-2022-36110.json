  "Description": "Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. Prior to version 0.15.1, Improper Authorization functions lead to non-privileged users running privileged API calls. If someone adds users to the Netmaker platform who do not have admin privileges, they can use their auth tokens to run admin-level functions via the API. This problem has been patched in v0.15.1.",
