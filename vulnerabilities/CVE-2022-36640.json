  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** influxData influxDB before v1.8.10 contains no authentication mechanism or controls, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands. NOTE: the CVE ID assignment is disputed because the vendor's documentation states \"If InfluxDB is being deployed on a publicly accessible endpoint, we strongly recommend authentication be enabled. Otherwise the data will be publicly available to any unauthenticated user. The default settings do NOT enable authentication and authorization.\"",
