  "Description": "ConnectWise ScreenConnect versions 22.6 and below contained a flaw allowing potential brute force attacks on custom access tokens due to inadequate rate-limiting controls in the default configuration. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access by repeatedly attempting access code combinations. ConnectWise has addressed this issue in later versions by implementing rate-limiting controls as a preventive measure against brute force attacks.",
