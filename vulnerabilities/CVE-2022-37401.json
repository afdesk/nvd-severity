  "Description": "Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user's configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulnerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects: Apache OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13. Reference: CVE-2022-26307 - LibreOffice",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
