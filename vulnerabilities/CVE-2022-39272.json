  "Description": "Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Versions prior to 0.35.0 are subject to a Denial of Service. Users that have permissions to change Flux\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed. This issue is patched in version 0.35.0. As a workaround, Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended mitigation.",
