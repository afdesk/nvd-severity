  "Description": "Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds.",
