  "Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Prior to versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8, malicious user can create a snapshot and arbitrarily choose the `originalUrl` parameter by editing the query, thanks to a web proxy. When another user opens the URL of the snapshot, they will be presented with the regular web interface delivered by the trusted Grafana server. The `Open original dashboard` button no longer points to the to the real original dashboard but to the attacker\u2019s injected URL. This issue is fixed in versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8.",
