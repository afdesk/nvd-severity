  "Description": "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Versions prior to version 0.2.4 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. Users whose model has a relation defined as a tupleset (the right hand side of a \u2018from\u2019 statement) that involves anything other than a direct relationship (e.g. \u2018as self\u2019) are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.",
