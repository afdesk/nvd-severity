  "Description": "Italtel NetMatch-S CI 5.2.0-20211008 allows Absolute Path Traversal under NMSCI-WebGui/SaveFileUploader. An unauthenticated user can upload files to an arbitrary path. An attacker can change the uploadDir parameter in a POST request (not possible using the GUI) to an arbitrary directory. Because the application does not check in which directory a file will be uploaded, an attacker can perform a variety of attacks that can result in unauthorized access to the server.",
