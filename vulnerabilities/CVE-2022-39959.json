  "Description": "Panini Everest Engine 2.0.4 allows unprivileged users to create a file named Everest.exe in the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini folder. This leads to privilege escalation because a service, running as SYSTEM, uses the unquoted path of %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest Engine\\EverestEngine.exe and therefore a Trojan horse %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest.exe may be executed instead of the intended vendor-supplied EverestEngine.exe file.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
