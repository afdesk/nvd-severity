  "Description": "If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and\npolicy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice\nrecursively.  On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this\nresults in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.  Policy\nprocessing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered\nto be a common setup.\n\nPolicy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy'\nargument to the command line utilities or by calling the\n`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.\n\nUpdate (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement\nwas corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.",
