  "Description": "The Quiz and Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to input validation bypass via the 'question[id]' parameter in versions up to, and including, 8.0.4 due to insufficient input validation that allows attackers to inject content other than the specified value (i.e. a number, file path, etc..). This makes it possible attackers to submit values other than the intended input type.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
