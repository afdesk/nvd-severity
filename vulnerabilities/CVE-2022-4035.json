  "Description": "The Appointment Hour Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to iFrame Injection via the \u2018email\u2019 or general field parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.3.72 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping that makes injecting iFrame tags possible. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject iFrames when submitting a booking that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected booking details page.",
