  "Description": "Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme Security before 15.8.211.19229 allows local users to escalate privileges. This occurs because of weak permissions for the %PROGRAMDATA%\\CheckPoint\\ZoneAlarm\\Data\\Updates directory, and a self-protection driver bypass that allows creation of a junction directory. This can be leveraged to perform an arbitrary file move as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
