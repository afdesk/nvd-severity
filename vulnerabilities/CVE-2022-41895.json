  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `MirrorPadGrad` is given outsize input `paddings`, TensorFlow will give a heap OOB error. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 717ca98d8c3bba348ff62281fdf38dcb5ea1ec92. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
