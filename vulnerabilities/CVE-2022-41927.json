  "Description": "XWiki Platform is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) that may allow attackers to delete or rename tags without needing any confirmation. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.4.1 and 14.5RC1. Workarounds: It's possible to patch existing instances directly by editing the page Main.Tags and add this kind of check, in the code for renaming and for deleting: ``` #if (!$services.csrf.isTokenValid($request.get('form_token'))) #set ($discard = $response.sendError(401, \"Wrong CSRF token\")) #end ```",
