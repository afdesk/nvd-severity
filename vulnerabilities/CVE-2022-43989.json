  "Description": "Password recovery vulnerability in SICK SIM2x00 (ARM) Partnumber 1092673 and 1081902 with firmware version < 1.2.0 allows an unprivileged remote attacker to gain access to the userlevel defined as RecoverableUserLevel by invocating the password recovery mechanism method. This leads to an increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The recommended solution is to update the firmware to a version >= 1.2.0 as soon as possible (available in SICK Support Portal).",
