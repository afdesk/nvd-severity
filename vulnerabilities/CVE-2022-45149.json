  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Moodle which exists due to insufficient validation of the HTTP request origin in course redirect URL. A user's CSRF token was unnecessarily included in the URL when being redirected to a course they have just restored. A remote attacker can trick the victim to visit a specially crafted web page and perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim on the vulnerable website. This flaw allows an attacker to perform cross-site request forgery attacks.",
