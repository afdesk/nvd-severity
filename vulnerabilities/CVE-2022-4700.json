  "Description": "The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insufficient access control in the 'wpr_activate_required_theme' AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59. This allows any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to activate the 'royal-elementor-kit' theme. If no such theme is installed doing so can also impact site availability as the site attempts to load a nonexistent theme.",
