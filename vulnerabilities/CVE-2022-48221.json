  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Acuant AcuFill SDK before 10.22.02.03. Multiple MSI's get executed out of a standard-user writable directory. Through a race condition and OpLock manipulation, these files can be overwritten by a standard user. They then get executed by the elevated installer. This gives a standard user full SYSTEM code execution (elevation of privileges).",
