  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/dasd: fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev due to missing pavgroup\n\nFix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev() function caused by the pavgroup\npointer being NULL.\n\nThe pavgroup pointer is checked on the entrance of the function but\nwithout the lcu->lock being held. Therefore there is a race window\nbetween dasd_alias_get_start_dev() and _lcu_update() which sets\npavgroup to NULL with the lcu->lock held.\n\nFix by checking the pavgroup pointer with lcu->lock held.",
