  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsfc: fix TX channel offset when using legacy interrupts\n\nIn legacy interrupt mode the tx_channel_offset was hardcoded to 1, but\nthat's not correct if efx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case,\nthe offset is 0 because the tx queues are in the single existing channel\nat index 0, together with the rx queue.\n\nWithout this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, it tries to\nget the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting these errors:\n  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/tx.c:540 efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]\n  [...]\n  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]\n  [...]\n  Call Trace:\n   <IRQ>\n   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230\n   sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360\n   __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40\n  [...]\n  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020\n  [...]\n  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]\n  [...]\n  Call Trace:\n   <IRQ>\n   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230\n   sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360\n   __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40\n  [...]",
