  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpio: mockup: fix NULL pointer dereference when removing debugfs\n\nWe now remove the device's debugfs entries when unbinding the driver.\nThis now causes a NULL-pointer dereference on module exit because the\nplatform devices are unregistered *after* the global debugfs directory\nhas been recursively removed. Fix it by unregistering the devices first.",
