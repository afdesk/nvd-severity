  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/debug: fix dentry leak in update_sched_domain_debugfs\n\nKuyo reports that the pattern of using debugfs_remove(debugfs_lookup())\nleaks a dentry and with a hotplug stress test, the machine eventually\nruns out of memory.\n\nFix this up by using the newly created debugfs_lookup_and_remove() call\ninstead which properly handles the dentry reference counting logic.",
