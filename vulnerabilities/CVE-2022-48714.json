  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Use VM_MAP instead of VM_ALLOC for ringbuf\n\nAfter commit 2fd3fb0be1d1 (\"kasan, vmalloc: unpoison VM_ALLOC pages\nafter mapping\"), non-VM_ALLOC mappings will be marked as accessible\nin __get_vm_area_node() when KASAN is enabled. But now the flag for\nringbuf area is VM_ALLOC, so KASAN will complain out-of-bound access\nafter vmap() returns. Because the ringbuf area is created by mapping\nallocated pages, so use VM_MAP instead.\n\nAfter the change, info in /proc/vmallocinfo also changes from\n  [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmalloc user\nto\n  [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmap user",
