  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: uniphier: fix reference count leak in uniphier_spi_probe()\n\nThe issue happens in several error paths in uniphier_spi_probe().\nWhen either dma_get_slave_caps() or devm_spi_register_master() returns\nan error code, the function forgets to decrease the refcount of both\n`dma_rx` and `dma_tx` objects, which may lead to refcount leaks.\n\nFix it by decrementing the reference count of specific objects in\nthose error paths.",
