  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nselinux: fix double free of cond_list on error paths\n\nOn error path from cond_read_list() and duplicate_policydb_cond_list()\nthe cond_list_destroy() gets called a second time in caller functions,\nresulting in NULL pointer deref.  Fix this by resetting the\ncond_list_len to 0 in cond_list_destroy(), making subsequent calls a\nnoop.\n\nAlso consistently reset the cond_list pointer to NULL after freeing.\n\n[PM: fix line lengths in the description]",
