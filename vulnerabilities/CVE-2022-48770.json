  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Guard against accessing NULL pt_regs in bpf_get_task_stack()\n\ntask_pt_regs() can return NULL on powerpc for kernel threads. This is\nthen used in __bpf_get_stack() to check for user mode, resulting in a\nkernel oops. Guard against this by checking return value of\ntask_pt_regs() before trying to obtain the call chain.",
