  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy\n\nA failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in\nthe file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This\nenables userland to refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still\nvalid file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free\nexploitation scenarios.\n\nFix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopy\nhas succeeded.",
