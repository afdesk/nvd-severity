  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mscc: ocelot: fix use-after-free in ocelot_vlan_del()\n\nocelot_vlan_member_del() will free the struct ocelot_bridge_vlan, so if\nthis is the same as the port's pvid_vlan which we access afterwards,\nwhat we're accessing is freed memory.\n\nFix the bug by determining whether to clear ocelot_port->pvid_vlan prior\nto calling ocelot_vlan_member_del().",
