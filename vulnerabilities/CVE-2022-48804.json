  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvt_ioctl: fix array_index_nospec in vt_setactivate\n\narray_index_nospec ensures that an out-of-bounds value is set to zero\non the transient path. Decreasing the value by one afterwards causes\na transient integer underflow. vsa.console should be decreased first\nand then sanitized with array_index_nospec.\n\nKasper Acknowledgements: Jakob Koschel, Brian Johannesmeyer, Kaveh\nRazavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida from the VUSec group at VU\nAmsterdam.",
