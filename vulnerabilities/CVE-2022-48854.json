  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: arc_emac: Fix use after free in arc_mdio_probe()\n\nIf bus->state is equal to MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED, mdiobus_free(bus) will free\nthe \"bus\". But bus->name is still used in the next line, which will lead\nto a use after free.\n\nWe can fix it by putting the name in a local variable and make the\nbus->name point to the rodata section \"name\",then use the name in the\nerror message without referring to bus to avoid the uaf.",
