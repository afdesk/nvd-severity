  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free race condition for maps\n\nIt is possible that in between calling fastrpc_map_get() until\nmap->fl->lock is taken in fastrpc_free_map(), another thread can call\nfastrpc_map_lookup() and get a reference to a map that is about to be\ndeleted.\n\nRewrite fastrpc_map_get() to only increase the reference count of a map\nif it's non-zero. Propagate this to callers so they can know if a map is\nabout to be deleted.\n\nFixes this warning:\nrefcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 10100 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate\n...\nCall trace:\n refcount_warn_saturate\n [fastrpc_map_get inlined]\n [fastrpc_map_lookup inlined]\n fastrpc_map_create\n fastrpc_internal_invoke\n fastrpc_device_ioctl\n __arm64_sys_ioctl\n invoke_syscall",
