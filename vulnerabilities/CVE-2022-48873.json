  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: Don't remove map on creater_process and device_release\n\nDo not remove the map from the list on error path in\nfastrpc_init_create_process, instead call fastrpc_map_put, to avoid\nuse-after-free. Do not remove it on fastrpc_device_release either,\ncall fastrpc_map_put instead.\n\nThe fastrpc_free_map is the only proper place to remove the map.\nThis is called only after the reference count is 0.",
