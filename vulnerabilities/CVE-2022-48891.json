  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: da9211: Use irq handler when ready\n\nIf the system does not come from reset (like when it is kexec()), the\nregulator might have an IRQ waiting for us.\n\nIf we enable the IRQ handler before its structures are ready, we crash.\n\nThis patch fixes:\n\n[    1.141839] Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address 0000000000000078\n[    1.316096] Call trace:\n[    1.316101]  blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x20/0xa8\n[    1.322757] cpu cpu0: dummy supplies not allowed for exclusive requests\n[    1.327823]  regulator_notifier_call_chain+0x1c/0x2c\n[    1.327825]  da9211_irq_handler+0x68/0xf8\n[    1.327829]  irq_thread+0x11c/0x234\n[    1.327833]  kthread+0x13c/0x154",
