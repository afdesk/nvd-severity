  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/gt: Cleanup partial engine discovery failures\n\nIf we abort driver initialisation in the middle of gt/engine discovery,\nsome engines will be fully setup and some not. Those incompletely setup\nengines only have 'engine->release == NULL' and so will leak any of the\ncommon objects allocated.\n\nv2:\n - Drop the destroy_pinned_context() helper for now.  It's not really\n   worth it with just a single callsite at the moment.  (Janusz)",
