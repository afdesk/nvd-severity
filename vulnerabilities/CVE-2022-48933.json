  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leak during stateful obj update\n\nstateful objects can be updated from the control plane.\nThe transaction logic allocates a temporary object for this purpose.\n\nThe ->init function was called for this object, so plain kfree() leaks\nresources. We must call ->destroy function of the object.\n\nnft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,\nbut the update path doesn't increment it.\n\nTo avoid special-casing the update object release, do module_get for\nthe update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().",
