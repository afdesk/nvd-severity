  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigb: Initialize mailbox message for VF reset\n\nWhen a MAC address is not assigned to the VF, that portion of the message\nsent to the VF is not set. The memory, however, is allocated from the\nstack meaning that information may be leaked to the VM. Initialize the\nmessage buffer to 0 so that no information is passed to the VM in this\ncase.",
