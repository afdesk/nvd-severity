  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: mt7621: Add sentinel to quirks table\n\nCurrent driver is missing a sentinel in the struct soc_device_attribute\narray, which causes an oops when assessed by the\nsoc_device_match(mt7621_pcie_quirks_match) call.\n\nThis was only exposed once the CONFIG_SOC_MT7621 mt7621 soc_dev_attr\nwas fixed to register the SOC as a device, in:\n\ncommit 7c18b64bba3b (\"mips: ralink: mt7621: do not use kzalloc too early\")\n\nFix it by adding the required sentinel.",
