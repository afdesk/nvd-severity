  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: af_can: fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rcv_filter\n\nAnalogue to commit 8aa59e355949 (\"can: af_can: fix NULL pointer\ndereference in can_rx_register()\") we need to check for a missing\ninitialization of ml_priv in the receive path of CAN frames.\n\nSince commit 4e096a18867a (\"net: introduce CAN specific pointer in the\nstruct net_device\") the check for dev->type to be ARPHRD_CAN is not\nsufficient anymore since bonding or tun netdevices claim to be CAN\ndevices but do not initialize ml_priv accordingly.",
