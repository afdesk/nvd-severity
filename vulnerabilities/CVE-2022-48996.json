  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/sysfs: fix wrong empty schemes assumption under online tuning in damon_sysfs_set_schemes()\n\nCommit da87878010e5 (\"mm/damon/sysfs: support online inputs update\") made\n'damon_sysfs_set_schemes()' to be called for running DAMON context, which\ncould have schemes.  In the case, DAMON sysfs interface is supposed to\nupdate, remove, or add schemes to reflect the sysfs files.  However, the\ncode is assuming the DAMON context wouldn't have schemes at all, and\ntherefore creates and adds new schemes.  As a result, the code doesn't\nwork as intended for online schemes tuning and could have more than\nexpected memory footprint.  The schemes are all in the DAMON context, so\nit doesn't leak the memory, though.\n\nRemove the wrong asssumption (the DAMON context wouldn't have schemes) in\n'damon_sysfs_set_schemes()' to fix the bug.",
