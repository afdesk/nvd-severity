  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: can327: can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(): fix potential skb leak when netdev is down\n\nIn can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(), it did not free the skb when netdev\nis down, and all callers of can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() did not free\nallocated skb too. That would trigger skb leak.\n\nFix it by adding kfree_skb() in can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() when netdev\nis down. Not tested, just compiled.",
