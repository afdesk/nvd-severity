  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/9p: Fix a potential socket leak in p9_socket_open\n\nBoth p9_fd_create_tcp() and p9_fd_create_unix() will call\np9_socket_open(). If the creation of p9_trans_fd fails,\np9_fd_create_tcp() and p9_fd_create_unix() will return an\nerror directly instead of releasing the cscoket, which will\nresult in a socket leak.\n\nThis patch adds sock_release() to fix the leak issue.",
