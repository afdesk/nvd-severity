  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ne100: Fix possible use after free in e100_xmit_prepare\n\nIn e100_xmit_prepare(), if we can't map the skb, then return -ENOMEM, so\ne100_xmit_frame() will return NETDEV_TX_BUSY and the upper layer will\nresend the skb. But the skb is already freed, which will cause UAF bug\nwhen the upper layer resends the skb.\n\nRemove the harmful free.",
