  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdkfd: Check for potential null return of kmalloc_array()\n\nAs the kmalloc_array() may return null, the 'event_waiters[i].wait' would lead to null-pointer dereference.\nTherefore, it is better to check the return value of kmalloc_array() to avoid this confusion.",
