  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v3: Fix GICR_CTLR.RWP polling\n\nIt turns out that our polling of RWP is totally wrong when checking\nfor it in the redistributors, as we test the *distributor* bit index,\nwhereas it is a different bit number in the RDs... Oopsie boo.\n\nThis is embarassing. Not only because it is wrong, but also because\nit took *8 years* to notice the blunder...\n\nJust fix the damn thing.",
