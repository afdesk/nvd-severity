  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nDrivers: hv: vmbus: Fix potential crash on module unload\n\nThe vmbus driver relies on the panic notifier infrastructure to perform\nsome operations when a panic event is detected. Since vmbus can be built\nas module, it is required that the driver handles both registering and\nunregistering such panic notifier callback.\n\nAfter commit 74347a99e73a (\"x86/Hyper-V: Unload vmbus channel in hv panic callback\")\nthough, the panic notifier registration is done unconditionally in the module\ninitialization routine whereas the unregistering procedure is conditionally\nguarded and executes only if HV_FEATURE_GUEST_CRASH_MSR_AVAILABLE capability\nis set.\n\nThis patch fixes that by unconditionally unregistering the panic notifier\nin the module's exit routine as well.",
