  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmt76: fix monitor mode crash with sdio driver\n\nmt7921s driver may receive frames with fragment buffers. If there is a\nCTS packet received in monitor mode, the payload is 10 bytes only and\nneed 6 bytes header padding after RXD buffer. However, only RXD in the\nfirst linear buffer, if we pull buffer size RXD-size+6 bytes with\nskb_pull(), that would trigger \"BUG_ON(skb->len < skb->data_len)\" in\n__skb_pull().\n\nTo avoid the nonlinear buffer issue, enlarge the RXD size from 128 to\n256 to make sure all MCU operation in linear buffer.\n\n[   52.007562] kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:2313!\n[   52.007578] Internal error: Oops - BUG: 0 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[   52.007987] pc : skb_pull+0x48/0x4c\n[   52.008015] lr : mt7921_queue_rx_skb+0x494/0x890 [mt7921_common]\n[   52.008361] Call trace:\n[   52.008377]  skb_pull+0x48/0x4c\n[   52.008400]  mt76s_net_worker+0x134/0x1b0 [mt76_sdio 35339a92c6eb7d4bbcc806a1d22f56365565135c]\n[   52.008431]  __mt76_worker_fn+0xe8/0x170 [mt76 ef716597d11a77150bc07e3fdd68eeb0f9b56917]\n[   52.008449]  kthread+0x148/0x3ac\n[   52.008466]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x30",
