  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/bridge: Add missing pm_runtime_put_sync\n\npm_runtime_get_sync() will increase the rumtime PM counter\neven when it returns an error. Thus a pairing decrement is needed\nto prevent refcount leak. Fix this by replacing this API with\npm_runtime_resume_and_get(), which will not change the runtime\nPM counter on error. Besides, a matching decrement is needed\non the error handling path to keep the counter balanced.",
