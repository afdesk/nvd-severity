  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmt76: mt7921: fix crash when startup fails.\n\nIf the nic fails to start, it is possible that the\nreset_work has already been scheduled.  Ensure the\nwork item is canceled so we do not have use-after-free\ncrash in case cleanup is called before the work item\nis executed.\n\nThis fixes crash on my x86_64 apu2 when mt7921k radio\nfails to work.  Radio still fails, but OS does not\ncrash.",
