  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs: fix refcount leak of a dma_fence obj\n\nThis issue takes place in an error path in\namdgpu_cs_fence_to_handle_ioctl(). When `info->in.what` falls into\ndefault case, the function simply returns -EINVAL, forgetting to\ndecrement the reference count of a dma_fence obj, which is bumped\nearlier by amdgpu_cs_get_fence(). This may result in reference count\nleaks.\n\nFix it by decreasing the refcount of specific object before returning\nthe error code.",
