  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: do not double complete bio on errors during compressed reads\n\nI hit some weird panics while fixing up the error handling from\nbtrfs_lookup_bio_sums().  Turns out the compression path will complete\nthe bio we use if we set up any of the compression bios and then return\nan error, and then btrfs_submit_data_bio() will also call bio_endio() on\nthe bio.\n\nFix this by making btrfs_submit_compressed_read() responsible for\ncalling bio_endio() on the bio if there are any errors.  Currently it\nwas only doing it if we created the compression bios, otherwise it was\ndepending on btrfs_submit_data_bio() to do the right thing.  This\ncreates the above problem, so fix up btrfs_submit_compressed_read() to\nalways call bio_endio() in case of an error, and then simply return from\nbtrfs_submit_data_bio() if we had to call\nbtrfs_submit_compressed_read().",
