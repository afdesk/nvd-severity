  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/irdma: Prevent some integer underflows\n\nMy static checker complains that:\n\n    drivers/infiniband/hw/irdma/ctrl.c:3605 irdma_sc_ceq_init()\n    warn: can subtract underflow 'info->dev->hmc_fpm_misc.max_ceqs'?\n\nIt appears that \"info->dev->hmc_fpm_misc.max_ceqs\" comes from the firmware\nin irdma_sc_parse_fpm_query_buf() so, yes, there is a chance that it could\nbe zero.  Even if we trust the firmware, it's easy enough to change the\ncondition just as a hardenning measure.",
