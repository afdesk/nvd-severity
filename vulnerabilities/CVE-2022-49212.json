  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmtd: rawnand: atmel: fix refcount issue in atmel_nand_controller_init\n\nThe reference counting issue happens in several error handling paths\non a refcounted object \"nc->dmac\". In these paths, the function simply\nreturns the error code, forgetting to balance the reference count of\n\"nc->dmac\", increased earlier by dma_request_channel(), which may\ncause refcount leaks.\n\nFix it by decrementing the refcount of specific object in those error\npaths.",
