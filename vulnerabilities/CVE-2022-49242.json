  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: mxs: Fix error handling in mxs_sgtl5000_probe\n\nThis function only calls of_node_put() in the regular path.\nAnd it will cause refcount leak in error paths.\nFor example, when codec_np is NULL, saif_np[0] and saif_np[1]\nare not NULL, it will cause leaks.\n\nof_node_put() will check if the node pointer is NULL, so we can\ncall it directly to release the refcount of regular pointers.",
