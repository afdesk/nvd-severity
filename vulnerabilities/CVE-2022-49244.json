  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: mediatek: mt8192-mt6359: Fix error handling in mt8192_mt6359_dev_probe\n\nThe device_node pointer is returned by of_parse_phandle()  with refcount\nincremented. We should use of_node_put() on it when done.\n\nThis function only calls of_node_put() in the regular path.\nAnd it will cause refcount leak in error paths.\nFix this by calling of_node_put() in error handling too.",
