  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: don't delete queue kobject before its children\n\nkobjects aren't supposed to be deleted before their child kobjects are\ndeleted.  Apparently this is usually benign; however, a WARN will be\ntriggered if one of the child kobjects has a named attribute group:\n\n    sysfs group 'modes' not found for kobject 'crypto'\n    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at fs/sysfs/group.c:278 sysfs_remove_group+0x72/0x80\n    ...\n    Call Trace:\n      sysfs_remove_groups+0x29/0x40 fs/sysfs/group.c:312\n      __kobject_del+0x20/0x80 lib/kobject.c:611\n      kobject_cleanup+0xa4/0x140 lib/kobject.c:696\n      kobject_release lib/kobject.c:736 [inline]\n      kref_put include/linux/kref.h:65 [inline]\n      kobject_put+0x53/0x70 lib/kobject.c:753\n      blk_crypto_sysfs_unregister+0x10/0x20 block/blk-crypto-sysfs.c:159\n      blk_unregister_queue+0xb0/0x110 block/blk-sysfs.c:962\n      del_gendisk+0x117/0x250 block/genhd.c:610\n\nFix this by moving the kobject_del() and the corresponding\nkobject_uevent() to the correct place.",
