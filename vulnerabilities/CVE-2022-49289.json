  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuaccess: fix integer overflow on access_ok()\n\nThree architectures check the end of a user access against the\naddress limit without taking a possible overflow into account.\nPassing a negative length or another overflow in here returns\nsuccess when it should not.\n\nUse the most common correct implementation here, which optimizes\nfor a constant 'size' argument, and turns the common case into a\nsingle comparison.",
