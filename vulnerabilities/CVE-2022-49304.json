  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers: tty: serial: Fix deadlock in sa1100_set_termios()\n\nThere is a deadlock in sa1100_set_termios(), which is shown\nbelow:\n\n   (Thread 1)              |      (Thread 2)\n                           | sa1100_enable_ms()\nsa1100_set_termios()       |  mod_timer()\n spin_lock_irqsave() //(1) |  (wait a time)\n ...                       | sa1100_timeout()\n del_timer_sync()          |  spin_lock_irqsave() //(2)\n (wait timer to stop)      |  ...\n\nWe hold sport->port.lock in position (1) of thread 1 and\nuse del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler\nalso need sport->port.lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result,\nsa1100_set_termios() will block forever.\n\nThis patch moves del_timer_sync() before spin_lock_irqsave()\nin order to prevent the deadlock.",
