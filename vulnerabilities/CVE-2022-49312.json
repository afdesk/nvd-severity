  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: rtl8712: fix a potential memory leak in r871xu_drv_init()\n\nIn r871xu_drv_init(), if r8712_init_drv_sw() fails, then the memory\nallocated by r8712_alloc_io_queue() in r8712_usb_dvobj_init() is not\nproperly released as there is no action will be performed by\nr8712_usb_dvobj_deinit().\nTo properly release it, we should call r8712_free_io_queue() in\nr8712_usb_dvobj_deinit().\n\nBesides, in r871xu_dev_remove(), r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() will be called\nby r871x_dev_unload() under condition `padapter->bup` and\nr8712_free_io_queue() is called by r8712_free_drv_sw().\nHowever, r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() does not rely on `padapter->bup` and\ncalling r8712_free_io_queue() in r8712_free_drv_sw() is negative for\nbetter understading the code.\nSo I move r8712_usb_dvobj_deinit() into r871xu_dev_remove(), and remove\nr8712_free_io_queue() from r8712_free_drv_sw().",
