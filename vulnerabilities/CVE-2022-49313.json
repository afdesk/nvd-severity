  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers: usb: host: Fix deadlock in oxu_bus_suspend()\n\nThere is a deadlock in oxu_bus_suspend(), which is shown below:\n\n   (Thread 1)              |      (Thread 2)\n                           | timer_action()\noxu_bus_suspend()          |  mod_timer()\n spin_lock_irq() //(1)     |  (wait a time)\n ...                       | oxu_watchdog()\n del_timer_sync()          |  spin_lock_irq() //(2)\n (wait timer to stop)      |  ...\n\nWe hold oxu->lock in position (1) of thread 1, and use\ndel_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler\nalso need oxu->lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result,\noxu_bus_suspend() will block forever.\n\nThis patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of\nspin_lock_irq(), which could let timer handler to obtain\nthe needed lock.",
