  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: zynqmp_dma: In struct zynqmp_dma_chan fix desc_size data type\n\nIn zynqmp_dma_alloc/free_chan_resources functions there is a\npotential overflow in the below expressions.\n\ndma_alloc_coherent(chan->dev, (2 * chan->desc_size *\n\t\t   ZYNQMP_DMA_NUM_DESCS),\n\t\t   &chan->desc_pool_p, GFP_KERNEL);\n\ndma_free_coherent(chan->dev,(2 * ZYNQMP_DMA_DESC_SIZE(chan) *\n                 ZYNQMP_DMA_NUM_DESCS),\n                chan->desc_pool_v, chan->desc_pool_p);\n\nThe arguments desc_size and ZYNQMP_DMA_NUM_DESCS were 32 bit. Though\nthis overflow condition is not observed but it is a potential problem\nin the case of 32-bit multiplication. Hence fix it by changing the\ndesc_size data type to size_t.\n\nIn addition to coverity fix it also reuse ZYNQMP_DMA_DESC_SIZE macro in\ndma_alloc_coherent API argument.\n\nAddresses-Coverity: Event overflow_before_widen.",
