  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/huge_memory: Fix xarray node memory leak\n\nIf xas_split_alloc() fails to allocate the necessary nodes to complete the\nxarray entry split, it sets the xa_state to -ENOMEM, which xas_nomem()\nthen interprets as \"Please allocate more memory\", not as \"Please free\nany unnecessary memory\" (which was the intended outcome).  It's confusing\nto use xas_nomem() to free memory in this context, so call xas_destroy()\ninstead.",
