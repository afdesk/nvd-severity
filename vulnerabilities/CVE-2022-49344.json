  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Fix a data-race in unix_dgram_peer_wake_me().\n\nunix_dgram_poll() calls unix_dgram_peer_wake_me() without `other`'s\nlock held and check if its receive queue is full.  Here we need to\nuse unix_recvq_full_lockless() instead of unix_recvq_full(), otherwise\nKCSAN will report a data-race.",
