The bug message is:\n\nThe kernel message is shown below:\n\nkernel BUG at fs/inode.c:611!\nCall Trace:\n evict+0x282/0x4e0\n __dentry_kill+0x2b2/0x4d0\n dput+0x2dd/0x720\n do_renameat2+0x596/0x970\n __x64_sys_rename+0x78/0x90\n do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90\n\n[1] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215895\n\nThe bug is due to fuzzed inode has both inline_data and encrypted flags.\nDuring f2fs_evict_inode(), as the inode was deleted by rename(), it\nwill cause inline data conversion due to conflicting flags. The page\ncache will be polluted and the panic will be triggered in clear_inode().\n\nTry fixing the bug by doing more sanity checks for inline data inode in\nsanity_check_inode().",
