  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix reference count leak in smb_check_perm_dacl()\n\nThe issue happens in a specific path in smb_check_perm_dacl(). When\n\"id\" and \"uid\" have the same value, the function simply jumps out of\nthe loop without decrementing the reference count of the object\n\"posix_acls\", which is increased by get_acl() earlier. This may\nresult in memory leaks.\n\nFix it by decreasing the reference count of \"posix_acls\" before\njumping to label \"check_access_bits\".",
