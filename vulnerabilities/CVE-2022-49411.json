  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbfq: Make sure bfqg for which we are queueing requests is online\n\nBios queued into BFQ IO scheduler can be associated with a cgroup that\nwas already offlined. This may then cause insertion of this bfq_group\ninto a service tree. But this bfq_group will get freed as soon as last\nbio associated with it is completed leading to use after free issues for\nservice tree users. Fix the problem by making sure we always operate on\nonline bfq_group. If the bfq_group associated with the bio is not\nonline, we pick the first online parent.",
