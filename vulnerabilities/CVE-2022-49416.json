  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: fix use-after-free in chanctx code\n\nIn ieee80211_vif_use_reserved_context(), when we have an\nold context and the new context's replace_state is set to\nIEEE80211_CHANCTX_REPLACE_NONE, we free the old context\nin ieee80211_vif_use_reserved_reassign(). Therefore, we\ncannot check the old_ctx anymore, so we should set it to\nNULL after this point.\n\nHowever, since the new_ctx replace state is clearly not\nIEEE80211_CHANCTX_REPLACES_OTHER, we're not going to do\nanything else in this function and can just return to\navoid accessing the freed old_ctx.",
