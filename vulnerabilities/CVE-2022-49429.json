  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hfi1: Prevent panic when SDMA is disabled\n\nIf the hfi1 module is loaded with HFI1_CAP_SDMA off, a call to\nhfi1_write_iter() will dereference a NULL pointer and panic. A typical\nstack frame is:\n\n  sdma_select_user_engine [hfi1]\n  hfi1_user_sdma_process_request [hfi1]\n  hfi1_write_iter [hfi1]\n  do_iter_readv_writev\n  do_iter_write\n  vfs_writev\n  do_writev\n  do_syscall_64\n\nThe fix is to test for SDMA in hfi1_write_iter() and fail the I/O with\nEINVAL.",
