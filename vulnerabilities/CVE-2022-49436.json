  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking nvdimm_events_map elements\n\nRight now 'char *' elements allocated for individual 'stat_id' in\n'papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map[]' during papr_scm_pmu_check_events(), get\nleaked in papr_scm_remove() and papr_scm_pmu_register(),\npapr_scm_pmu_check_events() error paths.\n\nAlso individual 'stat_id' arent NULL terminated 'char *' instead they are fixed\n8-byte sized identifiers. However papr_scm_pmu_register() assumes it to be a\nNULL terminated 'char *' and at other places it assumes it to be a\n'papr_scm_perf_stat.stat_id' sized string which is 8-byes in size.\n\nFix this by allocating the memory for papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map to also\ninclude space for 'stat_id' entries. This is possible since number of available\nevents/stat_ids are known upfront. This saves some memory and one extra level of\nindirection from 'nvdimm_events_map' to 'stat_id'. Also rest of the code\ncan continue to call 'kfree(papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map)' without needing to\niterate over the array and free up individual elements.",
