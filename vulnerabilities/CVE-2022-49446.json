  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvdimm: Fix firmware activation deadlock scenarios\n\nLockdep reports the following deadlock scenarios for CXL root device\npower-management, device_prepare(), operations, and device_shutdown()\noperations for 'nd_region' devices:\n\n Chain exists of:\n   &nvdimm_region_key --> &nvdimm_bus->reconfig_mutex --> system_transition_mutex\n\n  Possible unsafe locking scenario:\n\n        CPU0                    CPU1\n        ----                    ----\n   lock(system_transition_mutex);\n                                lock(&nvdimm_bus->reconfig_mutex);\n                                lock(system_transition_mutex);\n   lock(&nvdimm_region_key);\n\n Chain exists of:\n   &cxl_nvdimm_bridge_key --> acpi_scan_lock --> &cxl_root_key\n\n  Possible unsafe locking scenario:\n\n        CPU0                    CPU1\n        ----                    ----\n   lock(&cxl_root_key);\n                                lock(acpi_scan_lock);\n                                lock(&cxl_root_key);\n   lock(&cxl_nvdimm_bridge_key);\n\nThese stem from holding nvdimm_bus_lock() over hibernate_quiet_exec()\nwhich walks the entire system device topology taking device_lock() along\nthe way. The nvdimm_bus_lock() is protecting against unregistration,\nmultiple simultaneous ops callers, and preventing activate_show() from\nracing activate_store(). For the first 2, the lock is redundant.\nUnregistration already flushes all ops users, and sysfs already prevents\nmultiple threads to be active in an ops handler at the same time. For\nthe last userspace should already be waiting for its last\nactivate_store() to complete, and does not need activate_show() to flush\nthe write side, so this lock usage can be deleted in these attributes.",
