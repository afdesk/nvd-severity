  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: arm_scmi: Fix list protocols enumeration in the base protocol\n\nWhile enumerating protocols implemented by the SCMI platform using\nBASE_DISCOVER_LIST_PROTOCOLS, the number of returned protocols is\ncurrently validated in an improper way since the check employs a sum\nbetween unsigned integers that could overflow and cause the check itself\nto be silently bypassed if the returned value 'loop_num_ret' is big\nenough.\n\nFix the validation avoiding the addition.",
