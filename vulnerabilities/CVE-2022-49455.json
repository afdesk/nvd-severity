  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: ocxl: fix possible double free in ocxl_file_register_afu\n\ninfo_release() will be called in device_unregister() when info->dev's\nreference count is 0. So there is no need to call ocxl_afu_put() and\nkfree() again.\n\nFix this by adding free_minor() and return to err_unregister error path.",
