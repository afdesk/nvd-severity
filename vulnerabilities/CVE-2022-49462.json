  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/a6xx: Fix refcount leak in a6xx_gpu_init\n\nof_parse_phandle() returns a node pointer with refcount\nincremented, we should use of_node_put() on it when not need anymore.\n\na6xx_gmu_init() passes the node to of_find_device_by_node()\nand of_dma_configure(), of_find_device_by_node() will takes its\nreference, of_dma_configure() doesn't need the node after usage.\n\nAdd missing of_node_put() to avoid refcount leak.",
