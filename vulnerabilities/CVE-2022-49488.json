  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/mdp5: Return error code in mdp5_mixer_release when deadlock is detected\n\nThere is a possibility for mdp5_get_global_state to return\n-EDEADLK when acquiring the modeset lock, but currently global_state in\nmdp5_mixer_release doesn't check for if an error is returned.\n\nTo avoid a NULL dereference error, let's have mdp5_mixer_release\ncheck if an error is returned and propagate that error.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/485181/",
