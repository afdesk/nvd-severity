  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-pci: fix a NULL pointer dereference in nvme_alloc_admin_tags\n\nIn nvme_alloc_admin_tags, the admin_q can be set to an error (typically\n-ENOMEM) if the blk_mq_init_queue call fails to set up the queue, which\nis checked immediately after the call. However, when we return the error\nmessage up the stack, to nvme_reset_work the error takes us to\nnvme_remove_dead_ctrl()\n  nvme_dev_disable()\n   nvme_suspend_queue(&dev->queues[0]).\n\nHere, we only check that the admin_q is non-NULL, rather than not\nan error or NULL, and begin quiescing a queue that never existed, leading\nto bad / NULL pointer dereference.",
