  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: remove two BUG() from skb_checksum_help()\n\nI have a syzbot report that managed to get a crash in skb_checksum_help()\n\nIf syzbot can trigger these BUG(), it makes sense to replace\nthem with more friendly WARN_ON_ONCE() since skb_checksum_help()\ncan instead return an error code.\n\nNote that syzbot will still crash there, until real bug is fixed.",
