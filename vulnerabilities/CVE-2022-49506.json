  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: Add vblank register/unregister callback functions\n\nWe encountered a kernel panic issue that callback data will be NULL when\nit's using in ovl irq handler. There is a timing issue between\nmtk_disp_ovl_irq_handler() and mtk_ovl_disable_vblank().\n\nTo resolve this issue, we use the flow to register/unregister vblank cb:\n- Register callback function and callback data when crtc creates.\n- Unregister callback function and callback data when crtc destroies.\n\nWith this solution, we can assure callback data will not be NULL when\nvblank is disable.",
