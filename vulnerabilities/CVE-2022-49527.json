  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: venus: hfi: avoid null dereference in deinit\n\nIf venus_probe fails at pm_runtime_put_sync the error handling first\ncalls hfi_destroy and afterwards hfi_core_deinit. As hfi_destroy sets\ncore->ops to NULL, hfi_core_deinit cannot call the core_deinit function\nanymore.\n\nAvoid this null pointer derefence by skipping the call when necessary.",
