  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Protect memory leak for NPIV ports sending PLOGI_RJT\n\nThere is a potential memory leak in lpfc_ignore_els_cmpl() and\nlpfc_els_rsp_reject() that was allocated from NPIV PLOGI_RJT\n(lpfc_rcv_plogi()'s login_mbox).\n\nCheck if cmdiocb->context_un.mbox was allocated in lpfc_ignore_els_cmpl(),\nand then free it back to phba->mbox_mem_pool along with mbox->ctx_buf for\nservice parameters.\n\nFor lpfc_els_rsp_reject() failure, free both the ctx_buf for service\nparameters and the login_mbox.",
