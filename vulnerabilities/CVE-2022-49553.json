  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: validate BOOT sectors_per_clusters\n\nWhen the NTFS BOOT sectors_per_clusters field is > 0x80, it represents a\nshift value.  Make sure that the shift value is not too large before using\nit (NTFS max cluster size is 2MB).  Return -EVINVAL if it too large.\n\nThis prevents negative shift values and shift values that are larger than\nthe field size.\n\nPrevents this UBSAN error:\n\n UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in ../fs/ntfs3/super.c:673:16\n shift exponent -192 is negative",
