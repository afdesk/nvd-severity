  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nzsmalloc: fix races between asynchronous zspage free and page migration\n\nThe asynchronous zspage free worker tries to lock a zspage's entire page\nlist without defending against page migration.  Since pages which haven't\nyet been locked can concurrently migrate off the zspage page list while\nlock_zspage() churns away, lock_zspage() can suffer from a few different\nlethal races.\n\nIt can lock a page which no longer belongs to the zspage and unsafely\ndereference page_private(), it can unsafely dereference a torn pointer to\nthe next page (since there's a data race), and it can observe a spurious\nNULL pointer to the next page and thus not lock all of the zspage's pages\n(since a single page migration will reconstruct the entire page list, and\ncreate_page_chain() unconditionally zeroes out each list pointer in the\nprocess).\n\nFix the races by using migrate_read_lock() in lock_zspage() to synchronize\nwith page migration.",
