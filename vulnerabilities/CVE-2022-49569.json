  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: bcm2835: bcm2835_spi_handle_err(): fix NULL pointer deref for non DMA transfers\n\nIn case a IRQ based transfer times out the bcm2835_spi_handle_err()\nfunction is called. Since commit 1513ceee70f2 (\"spi: bcm2835: Drop\ndma_pending flag\") the TX and RX DMA transfers are unconditionally\ncanceled, leading to NULL pointer derefs if ctlr->dma_tx or\nctlr->dma_rx are not set.\n\nFix the NULL pointer deref by checking that ctlr->dma_tx and\nctlr->dma_rx are valid pointers before accessing them.",
