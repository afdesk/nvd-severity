  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbe2net: Fix buffer overflow in be_get_module_eeprom\n\nbe_cmd_read_port_transceiver_data assumes that it is given a buffer that\nis at least PAGE_DATA_LEN long, or twice that if the module supports SFF\n8472. However, this is not always the case.\n\nFix this by passing the desired offset and length to\nbe_cmd_read_port_transceiver_data so that we only copy the bytes once.",
