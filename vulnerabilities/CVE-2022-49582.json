  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: fix NULL pointer dereference in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering\n\nThe \"ds\" iterator variable used in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering() ->\ndsa_switch_for_each_port() overwrites the \"dp\" received as argument,\nwhich is later used to call dsa_port_vlan_filtering() proper.\n\nAs a result, switches which do enter that code path (the ones with\nvlan_filtering_is_global=true) will dereference an invalid dp in\ndsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering() after leaving a VLAN-aware bridge.\n\nUse a dedicated \"other_dp\" iterator variable to avoid this from\nhappening.",
