  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigmp: Fix data-races around sysctl_igmp_llm_reports.\n\nWhile reading sysctl_igmp_llm_reports, it can be changed concurrently.\nThus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers.\n\nThis test can be packed into a helper, so such changes will be in the\nfollow-up series after net is merged into net-next.\n\n  if (ipv4_is_local_multicast(pmc->multiaddr) &&\n      !READ_ONCE(net->ipv4.sysctl_igmp_llm_reports))",
