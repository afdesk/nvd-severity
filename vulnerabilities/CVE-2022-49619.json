  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sfp: fix memory leak in sfp_probe()\n\nsfp_probe() allocates a memory chunk from sfp with sfp_alloc(). When\ndevm_add_action() fails, sfp is not freed, which leads to a memory leak.\n\nWe should use devm_add_action_or_reset() instead of devm_add_action().",
