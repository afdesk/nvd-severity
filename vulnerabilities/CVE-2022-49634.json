  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsysctl: Fix data-races in proc_dou8vec_minmax().\n\nA sysctl variable is accessed concurrently, and there is always a chance\nof data-race.  So, all readers and writers need some basic protection to\navoid load/store-tearing.\n\nThis patch changes proc_dou8vec_minmax() to use READ_ONCE() and\nWRITE_ONCE() internally to fix data-races on the sysctl side.  For now,\nproc_dou8vec_minmax() itself is tolerant to a data-race, but we still\nneed to add annotations on the other subsystem's side.",
