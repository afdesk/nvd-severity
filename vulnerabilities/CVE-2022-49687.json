  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio_net: fix xdp_rxq_info bug after suspend/resume\n\nThe following sequence currently causes a driver bug warning\nwhen using virtio_net:\n\n  # ip link set eth0 up\n  # echo mem > /sys/power/state (or e.g. # rtcwake -s 10 -m mem)\n  <resume>\n  # ip link set eth0 down\n\n  Missing register, driver bug\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 375 at net/core/xdp.c:138 xdp_rxq_info_unreg+0x58/0x60\n  Call trace:\n   xdp_rxq_info_unreg+0x58/0x60\n   virtnet_close+0x58/0xac\n   __dev_close_many+0xac/0x140\n   __dev_change_flags+0xd8/0x210\n   dev_change_flags+0x24/0x64\n   do_setlink+0x230/0xdd0\n   ...\n\nThis happens because virtnet_freeze() frees the receive_queue\ncompletely (including struct xdp_rxq_info) but does not call\nxdp_rxq_info_unreg(). Similarly, virtnet_restore() sets up the\nreceive_queue again but does not call xdp_rxq_info_reg().\n\nActually, parts of virtnet_freeze_down() and virtnet_restore_up()\nare almost identical to virtnet_close() and virtnet_open(): only\nthe calls to xdp_rxq_info_(un)reg() are missing. This means that\nwe can fix this easily and avoid such problems in the future by\njust calling virtnet_close()/open() from the freeze/restore handlers.\n\nAside from adding the missing xdp_rxq_info calls the only difference\nis that the refill work is only cancelled if netif_running(). However,\nthis should not make any functional difference since the refill work\nshould only be active if the network interface is actually up.",
