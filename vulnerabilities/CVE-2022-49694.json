  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: disable the elevator int del_gendisk\n\nThe elevator is only used for file system requests, which are stopped in\ndel_gendisk.  Move disabling the elevator and freeing the scheduler tags\nto the end of del_gendisk instead of doing that work in disk_release and\nblk_cleanup_queue to avoid a use after free on q->tag_set from\ndisk_release as the tag_set might not be alive at that point.\n\nMove the blk_qos_exit call as well, as it just depends on the elevator\nexit and would be the only reason to keep the not exactly cheap queue\nfreeze in disk_release.",
