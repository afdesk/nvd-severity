  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: use get_random_u32 instead of prandom\n\nbh might occur while updating per-cpu rnd_state from user context,\nie. local_out path.\n\nBUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: nginx/2725\ncaller is nft_ng_random_eval+0x24/0x54 [nft_numgen]\nCall Trace:\n check_preemption_disabled+0xde/0xe0\n nft_ng_random_eval+0x24/0x54 [nft_numgen]\n\nUse the random driver instead, this also avoids need for local prandom\nstate. Moreover, prandom now uses the random driver since d4150779e60f\n(\"random32: use real rng for non-deterministic randomness\").\n\nBased on earlier patch from Pablo Neira.",
