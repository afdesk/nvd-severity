  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: add reserved GDT blocks check\n\nWe capture a NULL pointer issue when resizing a corrupt ext4 image which\nis freshly clear resize_inode feature (not run e2fsck). It could be\nsimply reproduced by following steps. The problem is because of the\nresize_inode feature was cleared, and it will convert the filesystem to\nmeta_bg mode in ext4_resize_fs(), but the es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks was\nnot reduced to zero, so could we mistakenly call reserve_backup_gdb()\nand passing an uninitialized resize_inode to it when adding new group\ndescriptors.\n\n mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda 3G\n tune2fs -O ^resize_inode /dev/sda #forget to run requested e2fsck\n mount /dev/sda /mnt\n resize2fs /dev/sda 8G\n\n ========\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028\n CPU: 19 PID: 3243 Comm: resize2fs Not tainted 5.18.0-rc7-00001-gfde086c5ebfd #748\n ...\n RIP: 0010:ext4_flex_group_add+0xe08/0x2570\n ...\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  ext4_resize_fs+0xbec/0x1660\n  __ext4_ioctl+0x1749/0x24e0\n  ext4_ioctl+0x12/0x20\n  __x64_sys_ioctl+0xa6/0x110\n  do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n RIP: 0033:0x7f2dd739617b\n ========\n\nThe fix is simple, add a check in ext4_resize_begin() to make sure that\nthe es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks is zero when the resize_inode feature is\ndisabled.",
