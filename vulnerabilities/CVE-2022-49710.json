  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm mirror log: round up region bitmap size to BITS_PER_LONG\n\nThe code in dm-log rounds up bitset_size to 32 bits. It then uses\nfind_next_zero_bit_le on the allocated region. find_next_zero_bit_le\naccesses the bitmap using unsigned long pointers. So, on 64-bit\narchitectures, it may access 4 bytes beyond the allocated size.\n\nFix this bug by rounding up bitset_size to BITS_PER_LONG.\n\nThis bug was found by running the lvm2 testsuite with kasan.",
