  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni40e: Fix call trace in setup_tx_descriptors\n\nAfter PF reset and ethtool -t there was call trace in dmesg\nsometimes leading to panic. When there was some time, around 5\nseconds, between reset and test there were no errors.\n\nProblem was that pf reset calls i40e_vsi_close in prep_for_reset\nand ethtool -t calls i40e_vsi_close in diag_test. If there was not\nenough time between those commands the second i40e_vsi_close starts\nbefore previous i40e_vsi_close was done which leads to crash.\n\nAdd check to diag_test if pf is in reset and don't start offline\ntests if it is true.\nAdd netif_info(\"testing failed\") into unhappy path of i40e_diag_test()",
