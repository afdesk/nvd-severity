  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: nfcmrvl: Fix memory leak in nfcmrvl_play_deferred\n\nSimilar to the handling of play_deferred in commit 19cfe912c37b\n(\"Bluetooth: btusb: Fix memory leak in play_deferred\"), we thought\na patch might be needed here as well.\n\nCurrently usb_submit_urb is called directly to submit deferred tx\nurbs after unanchor them.\n\nSo the usb_giveback_urb_bh would failed to unref it in usb_unanchor_urb\nand cause memory leak.\n\nPut those urbs in tx_anchor to avoid the leak, and also fix the error\nhandling.",
