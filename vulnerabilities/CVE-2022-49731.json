  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nata: libata-core: fix NULL pointer deref in ata_host_alloc_pinfo()\n\nIn an unlikely (and probably wrong?) case that the 'ppi' parameter of\nata_host_alloc_pinfo() points to an array starting with a NULL pointer,\nthere's going to be a kernel oops as the 'pi' local variable won't get\nreassigned from the initial value of NULL. Initialize 'pi' instead to\n'&ata_dummy_port_info' to fix the possible kernel oops for good...\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static\nanalysis tool.",
