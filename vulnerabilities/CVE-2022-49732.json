  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsock: redo the psock vs ULP protection check\n\nCommit 8a59f9d1e3d4 (\"sock: Introduce sk->sk_prot->psock_update_sk_prot()\")\nhas moved the inet_csk_has_ulp(sk) check from sk_psock_init() to\nthe new tcp_bpf_update_proto() function. I'm guessing that this\nwas done to allow creating psocks for non-inet sockets.\n\nUnfortunately the destruction path for psock includes the ULP\nunwind, so we need to fail the sk_psock_init() itself.\nOtherwise if ULP is already present we'll notice that later,\nand call tcp_update_ulp() with the sk_proto of the ULP\nitself, which will most likely result in the ULP looping\nits callbacks.",
