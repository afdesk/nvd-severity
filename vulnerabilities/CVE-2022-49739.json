  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Always check inode size of inline inodes\n\nCheck if the inode size of stuffed (inline) inodes is within the allowed\nrange when reading inodes from disk (gfs2_dinode_in()).  This prevents\nus from on-disk corruption.\n\nThe two checks in stuffed_readpage() and gfs2_unstuffer_page() that just\ntruncate inline data to the maximum allowed size don't actually make\nsense, and they can be removed now as well.",
