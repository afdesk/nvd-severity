  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/uffd: fix pte marker when fork() without fork event\n\nPatch series \"mm: Fixes on pte markers\".\n\nPatch 1 resolves the syzkiller report from Pengfei.\n\nPatch 2 further harden pte markers when used with the recent swapin error\nmarkers.  The major case is we should persist a swapin error marker after\nfork(), so child shouldn't read a corrupted page.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nWhen fork(), dst_vma is not guaranteed to have VM_UFFD_WP even if src may\nhave it and has pte marker installed.  The warning is improper along with\nthe comment.  The right thing is to inherit the pte marker when needed, or\nkeep the dst pte empty.\n\nA vague guess is this happened by an accident when there's the prior patch\nto introduce src/dst vma into this helper during the uffd-wp feature got\ndeveloped and I probably messed up in the rebase, since if we replace\ndst_vma with src_vma the warning & comment it all makes sense too.\n\nHugetlb did exactly the right here (copy_hugetlb_page_range()).  Fix the\ngeneral path.\n\nReproducer:\n\nhttps://github.com/xupengfe/syzkaller_logs/blob/main/221208_115556_copy_page_range/repro.c\n\nBugzilla report: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216808",
