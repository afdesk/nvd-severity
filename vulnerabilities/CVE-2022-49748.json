  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/amd: fix potential integer overflow on shift of a int\n\nThe left shift of int 32 bit integer constant 1 is evaluated using 32 bit\narithmetic and then passed as a 64 bit function argument. In the case where\ni is 32 or more this can lead to an overflow.  Avoid this by shifting\nusing the BIT_ULL macro instead.",
