  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: designware: use casting of u64 in clock multiplication to avoid overflow\n\nIn functions i2c_dw_scl_lcnt() and i2c_dw_scl_hcnt() may have overflow\nby depending on the values of the given parameters including the ic_clk.\nFor example in our use case where ic_clk is larger than one million,\nmultiplication of ic_clk * 4700 will result in 32 bit overflow.\n\nAdd cast of u64 to the calculation to avoid multiplication overflow, and\nuse the corresponding define for divide.",
