  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nntfs: check overflow when iterating ATTR_RECORDs\n\nKernel iterates over ATTR_RECORDs in mft record in ntfs_attr_find(). \nBecause the ATTR_RECORDs are next to each other, kernel can get the next\nATTR_RECORD from end address of current ATTR_RECORD, through current\nATTR_RECORD length field.\n\nThe problem is that during iteration, when kernel calculates the end\naddress of current ATTR_RECORD, kernel may trigger an integer overflow bug\nin executing `a = (ATTR_RECORD*)((u8*)a + le32_to_cpu(a->length))`.  This\nmay wrap, leading to a forever iteration on 32bit systems.\n\nThis patch solves it by adding some checks on calculating end address\nof current ATTR_RECORD during iteration.",
