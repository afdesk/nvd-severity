  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: tcm_loop: Fix possible name leak in tcm_loop_setup_hba_bus()\n\nIf device_register() fails in tcm_loop_setup_hba_bus(), the name allocated\nby dev_set_name() need be freed. As comment of device_register() says, it\nshould use put_device() to give up the reference in the error path. So fix\nthis by calling put_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().\nThe 'tl_hba' will be freed in tcm_loop_release_adapter(), so it don't need\ngoto error label in this case.",
