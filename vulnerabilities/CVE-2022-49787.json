  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmmc: sdhci-pci: Fix possible memory leak caused by missing pci_dev_put()\n\npci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned\npci_dev. We need to use pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count\nbefore amd_probe() returns. There is no problem for the 'smbus_dev ==\nNULL' branch because pci_dev_put() can also handle the NULL input\nparameter case.",
