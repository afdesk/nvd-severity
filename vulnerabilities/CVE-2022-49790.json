  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: iforce - invert valid length check when fetching device IDs\n\nsyzbot is reporting uninitialized value at iforce_init_device() [1], for\ncommit 6ac0aec6b0a6 (\"Input: iforce - allow callers supply data buffer\nwhen fetching device IDs\") is checking that valid length is shorter than\nbytes to read. Since iforce_get_id_packet() stores valid length when\nreturning 0, the caller needs to check that valid length is longer than or\nequals to bytes to read.",
