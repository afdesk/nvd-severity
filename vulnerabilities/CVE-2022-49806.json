  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: microchip: sparx5: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in sparx_stats_init() and sparx5_start()\n\nsparx_stats_init() calls create_singlethread_workqueue() and not\nchecked the ret value, which may return NULL. And a null-ptr-deref may\nhappen:\n\nsparx_stats_init()\n    create_singlethread_workqueue() # failed, sparx5->stats_queue is NULL\n    queue_delayed_work()\n        queue_delayed_work_on()\n            __queue_delayed_work()  # warning here, but continue\n                __queue_work()      # access wq->flags, null-ptr-deref\n\nCheck the ret value and return -ENOMEM if it is NULL. So as\nsparx5_start().",
