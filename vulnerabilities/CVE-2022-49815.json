  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: fix missing xas_retry() in fscache mode\n\nThe xarray iteration only holds the RCU read lock and thus may encounter\nXA_RETRY_ENTRY if there's process modifying the xarray concurrently.\nThis will cause oops when referring to the invalid entry.\n\nFix this by adding the missing xas_retry(), which will make the\niteration wind back to the root node if XA_RETRY_ENTRY is encountered.",
