  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsiox: fix possible memory leak in siox_device_add()\n\nIf device_register() returns error in siox_device_add(),\nthe name allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed. As\ncomment of device_register() says, it should use put_device()\nto give up the reference in the error path. So fix this\nby calling put_device(), then the name can be freed in\nkobject_cleanup(), and sdevice is freed in siox_device_release(),\nset it to null in error path.",
