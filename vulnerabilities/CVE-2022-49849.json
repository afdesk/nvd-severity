  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix match incorrectly in dev_args_match_device\n\nsyzkaller found a failed assertion:\n\n  assertion failed: (args->devid != (u64)-1) || args->missing, in fs/btrfs/volumes.c:6921\n\nThis can be triggered when we set devid to (u64)-1 by ioctl. In this\ncase, the match of devid will be skipped and the match of device may\nsucceed incorrectly.\n\nPatch 562d7b1512f7 introduced this function which is used to match device.\nThis function contains two matching scenarios, we can distinguish them by\nchecking the value of args->missing rather than check whether args->devid\nand args->uuid is default value.",
