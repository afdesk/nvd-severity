  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: process: fix kernel info leakage\n\nthread_struct's s[12] may contain random kernel memory content, which\nmay be finally leaked to userspace. This is a security hole. Fix it\nby clearing the s[12] array in thread_struct when fork.\n\nAs for kthread case, it's better to clear the s[12] array as well.",
