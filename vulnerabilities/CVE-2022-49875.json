  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpftool: Fix NULL pointer dereference when pin {PROG, MAP, LINK} without FILE\n\nWhen using bpftool to pin {PROG, MAP, LINK} without FILE,\nsegmentation fault will occur. The reson is that the lack\nof FILE will cause strlen to trigger NULL pointer dereference.\nThe corresponding stacktrace is shown below:\n\ndo_pin\n  do_pin_any\n    do_pin_fd\n      mount_bpffs_for_pin\n        strlen(name) <- NULL pointer dereference\n\nFix it by adding validation to the common process.",
