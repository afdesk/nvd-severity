  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: smm: number of GPRs in the SMRAM image depends on the image format\n\nOn 64 bit host, if the guest doesn't have X86_FEATURE_LM, KVM will\naccess 16 gprs to 32-bit smram image, causing out-ouf-bound ram\naccess.\n\nOn 32 bit host, the rsm_load_state_64/enter_smm_save_state_64\nis compiled out, thus access overflow can't happen.",
