  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: Initialize gfn_to_pfn_cache locks in dedicated helper\n\nMove the gfn_to_pfn_cache lock initialization to another helper and\ncall the new helper during VM/vCPU creation.  There are race\nconditions possible due to kvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_init()'s\nability to re-initialize the cache's locks.\n\nFor example: a race between ioctl(KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND) and\nkvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_init() leads to a corrupted shinfo gpc lock.\n\n                (thread 1)                |           (thread 2)\n                                          |\n kvm_xen_set_evtchn_fast                  |\n  read_lock_irqsave(&gpc->lock, ...)      |\n                                          | kvm_gfn_to_pfn_cache_init\n                                          |  rwlock_init(&gpc->lock)\n  read_unlock_irqrestore(&gpc->lock, ...) |\n\nRename \"cache_init\" and \"cache_destroy\" to activate+deactivate to\navoid implying that the cache really is destroyed/freed.\n\nNote, there more races in the newly named kvm_gpc_activate() that will\nbe addressed separately.\n\n[sean: call out that this is a bug fix]",
