  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfscrypt: fix keyring memory leak on mount failure\n\nCommit d7e7b9af104c (\"fscrypt: stop using keyrings subsystem for\nfscrypt_master_key\") moved the keyring destruction from __put_super() to\ngeneric_shutdown_super() so that the filesystem's block device(s) are\nstill available.  Unfortunately, this causes a memory leak in the case\nwhere a mount is attempted with the test_dummy_encryption mount option,\nbut the mount fails after the option has already been processed.\n\nTo fix this, attempt the keyring destruction in both places.",
