  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: piix4: Fix adapter not be removed in piix4_remove()\n\nIn piix4_probe(), the piix4 adapter will be registered in:\n\n   piix4_probe()\n     piix4_add_adapters_sb800() / piix4_add_adapter()\n       i2c_add_adapter()\n\nBased on the probed device type, piix4_add_adapters_sb800() or single\npiix4_add_adapter() will be called.\nFor the former case, piix4_adapter_count is set as the number of adapters,\nwhile for antoher case it is not set and kept default *zero*.\n\nWhen piix4 is removed, piix4_remove() removes the adapters added in\npiix4_probe(), basing on the piix4_adapter_count value.\nBecause the count is zero for the single adapter case, the adapter won't\nbe removed and makes the sources allocated for adapter leaked, such as\nthe i2c client and device.\n\nThese sources can still be accessed by i2c or bus and cause problems.\nAn easily reproduced case is that if a new adapter is registered, i2c\nwill get the leaked adapter and try to call smbus_algorithm, which was\nalready freed:\n\nTriggered by: rmmod i2c_piix4 && modprobe max31730\n\n BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc053d860\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\n CPU: 0 PID: 3752 Comm: modprobe Tainted: G\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)\n RIP: 0010:i2c_default_probe (drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c:2259) i2c_core\n RSP: 0018:ffff888107477710 EFLAGS: 00000246\n ...\n <TASK>\n  i2c_detect (drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c:2302) i2c_core\n  __process_new_driver (drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c:1336) i2c_core\n  bus_for_each_dev (drivers/base/bus.c:301)\n  i2c_for_each_dev (drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c:1823) i2c_core\n  i2c_register_driver (drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c:1861) i2c_core\n  do_one_initcall (init/main.c:1296)\n  do_init_module (kernel/module/main.c:2455)\n  ...\n </TASK>\n ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\nFix this problem by correctly set piix4_adapter_count as 1 for the\nsingle adapter so it can be normally removed.",
