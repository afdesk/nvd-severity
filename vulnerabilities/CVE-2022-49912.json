  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests\n\nIn the test_no_shared_qgroup() and test_multiple_refs() qgroup self tests,\nif we fail to add the tree ref, remove the extent item or remove the\nextent ref, we are returning from the test function without freeing the\n\"old_roots\" ulist that was allocated by the previous calls to\nbtrfs_find_all_roots(). Fix that by calling ulist_free() before returning.",
