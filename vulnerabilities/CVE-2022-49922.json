  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: nfcmrvl: Fix potential memory leak in nfcmrvl_i2c_nci_send()\n\nnfcmrvl_i2c_nci_send() will be called by nfcmrvl_nci_send(), and skb\nshould be freed in nfcmrvl_i2c_nci_send(). However, nfcmrvl_nci_send()\nwill only free skb when i2c_master_send() return >=0, which means skb\nwill memleak when i2c_master_send() failed. Free skb no matter whether\ni2c_master_send() succeeds.",
