  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: nxp-nci: Fix potential memory leak in nxp_nci_send()\n\nnxp_nci_send() will call nxp_nci_i2c_write(), and only free skb when\nnxp_nci_i2c_write() failed. However, even if the nxp_nci_i2c_write()\nrun succeeds, the skb will not be freed in nxp_nci_i2c_write(). As the\nresult, the skb will memleak. nxp_nci_send() should also free the skb\nwhen nxp_nci_i2c_write() succeeds.",
