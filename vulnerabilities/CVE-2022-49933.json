  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: VMX: Reset eVMCS controls in VP assist page during hardware disabling\n\nReset the eVMCS controls in the per-CPU VP assist page during hardware\ndisabling instead of waiting until kvm-intel's module exit.  The controls\nare activated if and only if KVM creates a VM, i.e. don't need to be\nreset if hardware is never enabled.\n\nDoing the reset during hardware disabling will naturally fix a potential\nNULL pointer deref bug once KVM disables CPU hotplug while enabling and\ndisabling hardware (which is necessary to fix a variety of bugs).  If the\nkernel is running as the root partition, the VP assist page is unmapped\nduring CPU hot unplug, and so KVM's clearing of the eVMCS controls needs\nto occur with CPU hot(un)plug disabled, otherwise KVM could attempt to\nwrite to a CPU's VP assist page after it's unmapped.",
