  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: Fix UAF in ieee80211_scan_rx()\n\nieee80211_scan_rx() tries to access scan_req->flags after a\nnull check, but a UAF is observed when the scan is completed\nand __ieee80211_scan_completed() executes, which then calls\ncfg80211_scan_done() leading to the freeing of scan_req.\n\nSince scan_req is rcu_dereference()'d, prevent the racing in\n__ieee80211_scan_completed() by ensuring that from mac80211's\nPOV it is no longer accessed from an RCU read critical section\nbefore we call cfg80211_scan_done().",
