  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"usb: typec: ucsi: add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors()\"\n\nThe recent commit 87d0e2f41b8c (\"usb: typec: ucsi: add a common\nfunction ucsi_unregister_connectors()\") introduced a regression that\ncaused NULL dereference at reading the power supply sysfs.  It's a\nstale sysfs entry that should have been removed but remains with NULL\nops.  The commit changed the error handling to skip the entries after\na NULL con->wq, and this leaves the power device unreleased.\n\nFor addressing the regression, the straight revert is applied here.\nFurther code improvements can be done from the scratch again.",
