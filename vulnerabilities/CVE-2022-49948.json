  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvt: Clear selection before changing the font\n\nWhen changing the console font with ioctl(KDFONTOP) the new font size\ncan be bigger than the previous font. A previous selection may thus now\nbe outside of the new screen size and thus trigger out-of-bounds\naccesses to graphics memory if the selection is removed in\nvc_do_resize().\n\nPrevent such out-of-memory accesses by dropping the selection before the\nvarious con_font_set() console handlers are called.",
