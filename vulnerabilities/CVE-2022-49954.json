  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: iforce - wake up after clearing IFORCE_XMIT_RUNNING flag\n\nsyzbot is reporting hung task at __input_unregister_device() [1], for\niforce_close() waiting at wait_event_interruptible() with dev->mutex held\nis blocking input_disconnect_device() from __input_unregister_device().\n\nIt seems that the cause is simply that commit c2b27ef672992a20 (\"Input:\niforce - wait for command completion when closing the device\") forgot to\ncall wake_up() after clear_bit().\n\nFix this problem by introducing a helper that calls clear_bit() followed\nby wake_up_all().",
