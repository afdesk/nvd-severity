  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkcm: fix strp_init() order and cleanup\n\nstrp_init() is called just a few lines above this csk->sk_user_data\ncheck, it also initializes strp->work etc., therefore, it is\nunnecessary to call strp_done() to cancel the freshly initialized\nwork.\n\nAnd if sk_user_data is already used by KCM, psock->strp should not be\ntouched, particularly strp->work state, so we need to move strp_init()\nafter the csk->sk_user_data check.\n\nThis also makes a lockdep warning reported by syzbot go away.",
