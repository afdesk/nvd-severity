  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nieee802154/adf7242: defer destroy_workqueue call\n\nThere is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below\n\n  (FREE)                     |  (USE)\n  adf7242_remove             |  adf7242_channel\n   cancel_delayed_work_sync  |\n    destroy_workqueue (1)    |   adf7242_cmd_rx\n                             |    mod_delayed_work (2)\n                             |\n\nThe root cause for this race is that the upper layer (ieee802154) is\nunaware of this detaching event and the function adf7242_channel can\nbe called without any checks.\n\nTo fix this, we can add a flag write at the beginning of adf7242_remove\nand add flag check in adf7242_channel. Or we can just defer the\ndestructive operation like other commit 3e0588c291d6 (\"hamradio: defer\nax25 kfree after unregister_netdev\") which let the\nieee802154_unregister_hw() to handle the synchronization. This patch\ntakes the second option.\n\nruns\")",
