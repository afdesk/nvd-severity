  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: nintendo: fix rumble worker null pointer deref\n\nWe can dereference a null pointer trying to queue work to a destroyed\nworkqueue.\n\nIf the device is disconnected, nintendo_hid_remove is called, in which\nthe rumble_queue is destroyed. Avoid using that queue to defer rumble\nwork once the controller state is set to JOYCON_CTLR_STATE_REMOVED.\n\nThis eliminates the null pointer dereference.",
