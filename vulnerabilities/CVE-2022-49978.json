  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: fb_pm2fb: Avoid potential divide by zero error\n\nIn `do_fb_ioctl()` of fbmem.c, if cmd is FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO, var will be\ncopied from user, then go through `fb_set_var()` and\n`info->fbops->fb_check_var()` which could may be `pm2fb_check_var()`.\nAlong the path, `var->pixclock` won't be modified. This function checks\nwhether reciprocal of `var->pixclock` is too high. If `var->pixclock` is\nzero, there will be a divide by zero error. So, it is necessary to check\nwhether denominator is zero to avoid crash. As this bug is found by\nSyzkaller, logs are listed below.\n\ndivide error in pm2fb_check_var\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n fb_set_var+0x367/0xeb0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:1015\n do_fb_ioctl+0x234/0x670 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:1110\n fb_ioctl+0xdd/0x130 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:1189",
