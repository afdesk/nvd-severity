  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: pvrusb2: fix memory leak in pvr_probe\n\nThe error handling code in pvr2_hdw_create forgets to unregister the\nv4l2 device. When pvr2_hdw_create returns back to pvr2_context_create,\nit calls pvr2_context_destroy to destroy context, but mp->hdw is NULL,\nwhich leads to that pvr2_hdw_destroy directly returns.\n\nFix this by adding v4l2_device_unregister to decrease the refcount of\nusb interface.",
