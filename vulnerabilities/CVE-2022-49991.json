  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: avoid corrupting page->mapping in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte\n\nIn MCOPY_ATOMIC_CONTINUE case with a non-shared VMA, pages in the page\ncache are installed in the ptes.  But hugepage_add_new_anon_rmap is called\nfor them mistakenly because they're not vm_shared.  This will corrupt the\npage->mapping used by page cache code.",
