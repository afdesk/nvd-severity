  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nloop: Check for overflow while configuring loop\n\nThe userspace can configure a loop using an ioctl call, wherein\na configuration of type loop_config is passed (see lo_ioctl()'s\ncase on line 1550 of drivers/block/loop.c). This proceeds to call\nloop_configure() which in turn calls loop_set_status_from_info()\n(see line 1050 of loop.c), passing &config->info which is of type\nloop_info64*. This function then sets the appropriate values, like\nthe offset.\n\nloop_device has lo_offset of type loff_t (see line 52 of loop.c),\nwhich is typdef-chained to long long, whereas loop_info64 has\nlo_offset of type __u64 (see line 56 of include/uapi/linux/loop.h).\n\nThe function directly copies offset from info to the device as\nfollows (See line 980 of loop.c):\n\tlo->lo_offset = info->lo_offset;\n\nThis results in an overflow, which triggers a warning in iomap_iter()\ndue to a call to iomap_iter_done() which has:\n\tWARN_ON_ONCE(iter->iomap.offset > iter->pos);\n\nThus, check for negative value during loop_set_status_from_info().\n\nBug report: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=c620fe14aac810396d3c3edc9ad73848bf69a29e",
