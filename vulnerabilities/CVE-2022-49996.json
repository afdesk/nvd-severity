  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix possible memory leak in btrfs_get_dev_args_from_path()\n\nIn btrfs_get_dev_args_from_path(), btrfs_get_bdev_and_sb() can fail if\nthe path is invalid. In this case, btrfs_get_dev_args_from_path()\nreturns directly without freeing args->uuid and args->fsid allocated\nbefore, which causes memory leak.\n\nTo fix these possible leaks, when btrfs_get_bdev_and_sb() fails,\nbtrfs_put_dev_args_from_path() is called to clean up the memory.",
