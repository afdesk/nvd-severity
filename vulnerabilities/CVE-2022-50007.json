  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: fix refcount leak in __xfrm_policy_check()\n\nThe issue happens on an error path in __xfrm_policy_check(). When the\nfetching process of the object `pols[1]` fails, the function simply\nreturns 0, forgetting to decrement the reference count of `pols[0]`,\nwhich is incremented earlier by either xfrm_sk_policy_lookup() or\nxfrm_policy_lookup(). This may result in memory leaks.\n\nFix it by decreasing the reference count of `pols[0]` in that path.",
