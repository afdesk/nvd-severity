  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: avoid resizing to a partial cluster size\n\nThis patch avoids an attempt to resize the filesystem to an\nunaligned cluster boundary.  An online resize to a size that is not\nintegral to cluster size results in the last iteration attempting to\ngrow the fs by a negative amount, which trips a BUG_ON and leaves the fs\nwith a corrupted in-memory superblock.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN",
