  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers:md:fix a potential use-after-free bug\n\nIn line 2884, \"raid5_release_stripe(sh);\" drops the reference to sh and\nmay cause sh to be released. However, sh is subsequently used in lines\n2886 \"if (sh->batch_head && sh != sh->batch_head)\". This may result in an\nuse-after-free bug.\n\nIt can be fixed by moving \"raid5_release_stripe(sh);\" to the bottom of\nthe function.",
