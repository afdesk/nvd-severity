  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: qrtr: start MHI channel after endpoit creation\n\nMHI channel may generates event/interrupt right after enabling.\nIt may leads to 2 race conditions issues.\n\n1)\nSuch event may be dropped by qcom_mhi_qrtr_dl_callback() at check:\n\n\tif (!qdev || mhi_res->transaction_status)\n\t\treturn;\n\nBecause dev_set_drvdata(&mhi_dev->dev, qdev) may be not performed at\nthis moment. In this situation qrtr-ns will be unable to enumerate\nservices in device.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2)\nSuch event may come at the moment after dev_set_drvdata() and\nbefore qrtr_endpoint_register(). In this case kernel will panic with\naccessing wrong pointer at qcom_mhi_qrtr_dl_callback():\n\n\trc = qrtr_endpoint_post(&qdev->ep, mhi_res->buf_addr,\n\t\t\t\tmhi_res->bytes_xferd);\n\nBecause endpoint is not created yet.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSo move mhi_prepare_for_transfer_autoqueue after endpoint creation\nto fix it.",
