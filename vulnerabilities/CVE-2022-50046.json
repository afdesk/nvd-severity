  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sunrpc: fix potential memory leaks in rpc_sysfs_xprt_state_change()\n\nThe issue happens on some error handling paths. When the function\nfails to grab the object `xprt`, it simply returns 0, forgetting to\ndecrease the reference count of another object `xps`, which is\nincreased by rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt_switch(), causing refcount\nleaks. Also, the function forgets to check whether `xps` is valid\nbefore using it, which may result in NULL-dereferencing issues.\n\nFix it by adding proper error handling code when either `xprt` or\n`xps` is NULL.",
