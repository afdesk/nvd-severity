  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: DPCM: Don't pick up BE without substream\n\nWhen DPCM tries to add valid BE connections at dpcm_add_paths(), it\ndoesn't check whether the picked BE actually supports for the given\nstream direction.  Due to that, when an asymmetric BE stream is\npresent, it picks up wrongly and this may result in a NULL dereference\nat a later point where the code assumes the existence of a\ncorresponding BE substream.\n\nThis patch adds the check for the presence of the substream for the\ntarget BE for avoiding the problem above.\n\nNote that we have already some fix for non-existing BE substream at\ncommit 6246f283d5e0 (\"ASoC: dpcm: skip missing substream while\napplying symmetry\").  But the code path we've hit recently is rather\nhappening before the previous fix.  So this patch tries to fix at\npicking up a BE instead of parsing BE lists.",
