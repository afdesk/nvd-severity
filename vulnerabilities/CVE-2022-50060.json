  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteontx2-af: Fix mcam entry resource leak\n\nThe teardown sequence in FLR handler returns if no NIX LF\nis attached to PF/VF because it indicates that graceful\nshutdown of resources already happened. But there is a\nchance of all allocated MCAM entries not being freed by\nPF/VF. Hence free mcam entries even in case of detached LF.",
