  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: move subflow cleanup in mptcp_destroy_common()\n\nIf the mptcp socket creation fails due to a CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE\neBPF program, the MPTCP protocol ends-up leaking all the subflows:\nthe related cleanup happens in __mptcp_destroy_sock() that is not\ninvoked in such code path.\n\nAddress the issue moving the subflow sockets cleanup in the\nmptcp_destroy_common() helper, which is invoked in every msk cleanup\npath.\n\nAdditionally get rid of the intermediate list_splice_init step, which\nis an unneeded relic from the past.\n\nThe issue is present since before the reported root cause commit, but\nany attempt to backport the fix before that hash will require a complete\nrewrite.",
