  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\napparmor: fix reference count leak in aa_pivotroot()\n\nThe aa_pivotroot() function has a reference counting bug in a specific\npath. When aa_replace_current_label() returns on success, the function\nforgets to decrement the reference count of \u201ctarget\u201d, which is\nincreased earlier by build_pivotroot(), causing a reference leak.\n\nFix it by decreasing the refcount of \u201ctarget\u201d in that path.",
