  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm raid: fix address sanitizer warning in raid_status\n\nThere is this warning when using a kernel with the address sanitizer\nand running this testsuite:\nhttps://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-tests/-/tree/main/storage/swraid/scsi_raid\n\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in raid_status+0x1747/0x2820 [dm_raid]\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff888079d2c7e8 by task lvcreate/13319\nCPU: 0 PID: 13319 Comm: lvcreate Not tainted 5.18.0-0.rc3.<snip> #1\nHardware name: Red Hat KVM, BIOS 0.5.1 01/01/2011\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack_lvl+0x6a/0x9c\n print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1f/0x1e0\n print_report.cold+0x55/0x244\n kasan_report+0xc9/0x100\n raid_status+0x1747/0x2820 [dm_raid]\n dm_ima_measure_on_table_load+0x4b8/0xca0 [dm_mod]\n table_load+0x35c/0x630 [dm_mod]\n ctl_ioctl+0x411/0x630 [dm_mod]\n dm_ctl_ioctl+0xa/0x10 [dm_mod]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x12a/0x1a0\n do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x80\n\nThe warning is caused by reading conf->max_nr_stripes in raid_status. The\ncode in raid_status reads mddev->private, casts it to struct r5conf and\nreads the entry max_nr_stripes.\n\nHowever, if we have different raid type than 4/5/6, mddev->private\ndoesn't point to struct r5conf; it may point to struct r0conf, struct\nr1conf, struct r10conf or struct mpconf. If we cast a pointer to one\nof these structs to struct r5conf, we will be reading invalid memory\nand KASAN warns about it.\n\nFix this bug by reading struct r5conf only if raid type is 4, 5 or 6.",
