  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: don't allow the same type rq_qos add more than once\n\nIn our test of iocost, we encountered some list add/del corruptions of\ninner_walk list in ioc_timer_fn.\n\nThe reason can be described as follows:\n\ncpu 0\t\t\t\t\tcpu 1\nioc_qos_write\t\t\t\tioc_qos_write\n\nioc = q_to_ioc(queue);\nif (!ioc) {\n        ioc = kzalloc();\n\t\t\t\t\tioc = q_to_ioc(queue);\n\t\t\t\t\tif (!ioc) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tioc = kzalloc();\n\t\t\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\t\t\trq_qos_add(q, rqos);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n        ...\n        rq_qos_add(q, rqos);\n        ...\n}\n\nWhen the io.cost.qos file is written by two cpus concurrently, rq_qos may\nbe added to one disk twice. In that case, there will be two iocs enabled\nand running on one disk. They own different iocgs on their active list. In\nthe ioc_timer_fn function, because of the iocgs from two iocs have the\nsame root iocg, the root iocg's walk_list may be overwritten by each other\nand this leads to list add/del corruptions in building or destroying the\ninner_walk list.\n\nAnd so far, the blk-rq-qos framework works in case that one instance for\none type rq_qos per queue by default. This patch make this explicit and\nalso fix the crash above.",
