  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: arm_scpi: Ensure scpi_info is not assigned if the probe fails\n\nWhen scpi probe fails, at any point, we need to ensure that the scpi_info\nis not set and will remain NULL until the probe succeeds. If it is not\ntaken care, then it could result use-after-free as the value is exported\nvia get_scpi_ops() and could refer to a memory allocated via devm_kzalloc()\nbut freed when the probe fails.",
