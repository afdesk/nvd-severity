  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/reclaim: fix potential memory leak in damon_reclaim_init()\n\ndamon_reclaim_init() allocates a memory chunk for ctx with\ndamon_new_ctx().  When damon_select_ops() fails, ctx is not released,\nwhich will lead to a memory leak.\n\nWe should release the ctx with damon_destroy_ctx() when damon_select_ops()\nfails to fix the memory leak.",
