  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlocking/csd_lock: Change csdlock_debug from early_param to __setup\n\nThe csdlock_debug kernel-boot parameter is parsed by the\nearly_param() function csdlock_debug().  If set, csdlock_debug()\ninvokes static_branch_enable() to enable csd_lock_wait feature, which\ntriggers a panic on arm64 for kernels built with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM=y and\nCONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n.\n\nWith CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n, __nr_to_section is called in\nstatic_key_enable() and returns NULL, resulting in a NULL dereference\nbecause mem_section is initialized only later in sparse_init().\n\nThis is also a problem for powerpc because early_param() functions\nare invoked earlier than jump_label_init(), also resulting in\nstatic_key_enable() failures.  These failures cause the warning \"static\nkey 'xxx' used before call to jump_label_init()\".\n\nThus, early_param is too early for csd_lock_wait to run\nstatic_branch_enable(), so changes it to __setup to fix these.",
