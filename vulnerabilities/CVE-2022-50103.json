  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched, cpuset: Fix dl_cpu_busy() panic due to empty cs->cpus_allowed\n\nWith cgroup v2, the cpuset's cpus_allowed mask can be empty indicating\nthat the cpuset will just use the effective CPUs of its parent. So\ncpuset_can_attach() can call task_can_attach() with an empty mask.\nThis can lead to cpumask_any_and() returns nr_cpu_ids causing the call\nto dl_bw_of() to crash due to percpu value access of an out of bound\nCPU value. For example:\n\n\t[80468.182258] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff8b6648b0\n\t  :\n\t[80468.191019] RIP: 0010:dl_cpu_busy+0x30/0x2b0\n\t  :\n\t[80468.207946] Call Trace:\n\t[80468.208947]  cpuset_can_attach+0xa0/0x140\n\t[80468.209953]  cgroup_migrate_execute+0x8c/0x490\n\t[80468.210931]  cgroup_update_dfl_csses+0x254/0x270\n\t[80468.211898]  cgroup_subtree_control_write+0x322/0x400\n\t[80468.212854]  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x11c/0x1b0\n\t[80468.213777]  new_sync_write+0x11f/0x1b0\n\t[80468.214689]  vfs_write+0x1eb/0x280\n\t[80468.215592]  ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0\n\t[80468.216463]  do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x80\n\t[80468.224287]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n\nFix that by using effective_cpus instead. For cgroup v1, effective_cpus\nis the same as cpus_allowed. For v2, effective_cpus is the real cpumask\nto be used by tasks within the cpuset anyway.\n\nAlso update task_can_attach()'s 2nd argument name to cs_effective_cpus to\nreflect the change. In addition, a check is added to task_can_attach()\nto guard against the possibility that cpumask_any_and() may return a\nvalue >= nr_cpu_ids.",
