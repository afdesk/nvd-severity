  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/rxe: Fix error unwind in rxe_create_qp()\n\nIn the function rxe_create_qp(), rxe_qp_from_init() is called to\ninitialize qp, internally things like the spin locks are not setup until\nrxe_qp_init_req().\n\nIf an error occures before this point then the unwind will call\nrxe_cleanup() and eventually to rxe_qp_do_cleanup()/rxe_cleanup_task()\nwhich will oops when trying to access the uninitialized spinlock.\n\nMove the spinlock initializations earlier before any failures.",
