  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/srpt: Fix a use-after-free\n\nChange the LIO port members inside struct srpt_port from regular members\ninto pointers. Allocate the LIO port data structures from inside\nsrpt_make_tport() and free these from inside srpt_make_tport(). Keep\nstruct srpt_device as long as either an RDMA port or a LIO target port is\nassociated with it. This patch decouples the lifetime of struct srpt_port\n(controlled by the RDMA core) and struct srpt_port_id (controlled by LIO).\nThis patch fixes the following KASAN complaint:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in srpt_enable_tpg+0x31/0x70 [ib_srpt]\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff888141cc34b8 by task check/5093\n\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   show_stack+0x4e/0x53\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x51/0x66\n   print_address_description.constprop.0.cold+0xea/0x41e\n   print_report.cold+0x90/0x205\n   kasan_report+0xb9/0xf0\n   __asan_load8+0x69/0x90\n   srpt_enable_tpg+0x31/0x70 [ib_srpt]\n   target_fabric_tpg_base_enable_store+0xe2/0x140 [target_core_mod]\n   configfs_write_iter+0x18b/0x210\n   new_sync_write+0x1f2/0x2f0\n   vfs_write+0x3e3/0x540\n   ksys_write+0xbb/0x140\n   __x64_sys_write+0x42/0x50\n   do_syscall_64+0x34/0x80\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0\n   </TASK>",
