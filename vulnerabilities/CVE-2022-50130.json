  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: fbtft: core: set smem_len before fb_deferred_io_init call\n\nThe fbtft_framebuffer_alloc() calls fb_deferred_io_init() before\ninitializing info->fix.smem_len.  It is set to zero by the\nframebuffer_alloc() function.  It will trigger a WARN_ON() at the\nstart of fb_deferred_io_init() and the function will not do anything.",
