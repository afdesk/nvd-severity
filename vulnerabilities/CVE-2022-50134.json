  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hfi1: fix potential memory leak in setup_base_ctxt()\n\nsetup_base_ctxt() allocates a memory chunk for uctxt->groups with\nhfi1_alloc_ctxt_rcv_groups(). When init_user_ctxt() fails, uctxt->groups\nis not released, which will lead to a memory leak.\n\nWe should release the uctxt->groups with hfi1_free_ctxt_rcv_groups()\nwhen init_user_ctxt() fails.",
