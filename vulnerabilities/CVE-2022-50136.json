  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/siw: Fix duplicated reported IW_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REPLY event\n\nIf siw_recv_mpa_rr returns -EAGAIN, it means that the MPA reply hasn't\nbeen received completely, and should not report IW_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REPLY\nin this case. This may trigger a call trace in iw_cm. A simple way to\ntrigger this:\n server: ib_send_lat\n client: ib_send_lat -R <server_ip>\n\nThe call trace looks like this:\n\n kernel BUG at drivers/infiniband/core/iwcm.c:894!\n invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n <...>\n Workqueue: iw_cm_wq cm_work_handler [iw_cm]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  cm_work_handler+0x1dd/0x370 [iw_cm]\n  process_one_work+0x1e2/0x3b0\n  worker_thread+0x49/0x2e0\n  ? rescuer_thread+0x370/0x370\n  kthread+0xe5/0x110\n  ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20\n  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n  </TASK>",
