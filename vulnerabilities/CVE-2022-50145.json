  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread support for a DMA channel\n\nWhen we get a DMA channel and try to use it in multiple threads it\nwill cause oops and hanging the system.\n\n% echo 64 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/threads_per_chan\n% echo 10000 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/iterations\n% echo 1 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/run\n[   89.480664] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual\n               address 00000000000000a0\n[   89.488725] Oops [#1]\n[   89.494708] CPU: 2 PID: 1008 Comm: dma0chan0-copy0 Not tainted\n               5.17.0-rc5\n[   89.509385] epc : vchan_find_desc+0x32/0x46\n[   89.513553]  ra : sf_pdma_tx_status+0xca/0xd6\n\nThis happens because of data race. Each thread rewrite channels's\ndescriptor as soon as device_prep_dma_memcpy() is called. It leads to the\nsituation when the driver thinks that it uses right descriptor that\nactually is freed or substituted for other one.\n\nWith current fixes a descriptor changes its value only when it has\nbeen used. A new descriptor is acquired from vc->desc_issued queue that\nis already filled with descriptors that are ready to be sent. Threads\nhave no direct access to DMA channel descriptor. Now it is just possible\nto queue a descriptor for further processing.",
