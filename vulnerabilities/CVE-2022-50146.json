  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: dwc: Deallocate EPC memory on dw_pcie_ep_init() errors\n\nIf dw_pcie_ep_init() fails to perform any action after the EPC memory is\ninitialized and the MSI memory region is allocated, the latter parts won't\nbe undone thus causing a memory leak.  Add a cleanup-on-error path to fix\nthese leaks.\n\n[bhelgaas: commit log]",
