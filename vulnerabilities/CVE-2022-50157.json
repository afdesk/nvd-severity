  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: microchip: Fix refcount leak in mc_pcie_init_irq_domains()\n\nof_get_next_child() returns a node pointer with refcount incremented, so we\nshould use of_node_put() on it when we don't need it anymore.\n\nmc_pcie_init_irq_domains() only calls of_node_put() in the normal path,\nmissing it in some error paths.  Add missing of_node_put() to avoid\nrefcount leak.",
