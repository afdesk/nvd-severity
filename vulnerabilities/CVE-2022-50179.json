  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nath9k: fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb\n\nSyzbot reported use-after-free Read in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb() [0]. The\nproblem was in incorrect htc_handle->drv_priv initialization.\n\nProbable call trace which can trigger use-after-free:\n\nath9k_htc_probe_device()\n  /* htc_handle->drv_priv = priv; */\n  ath9k_htc_wait_for_target()      <--- Failed\n  ieee80211_free_hw()\t\t   <--- priv pointer is freed\n\n<IRQ>\n...\nath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb()\n  ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream()\n   RX_STAT_INC()\t\t<--- htc_handle->drv_priv access\n\nIn order to not add fancy protection for drv_priv we can move\nhtc_handle->drv_priv initialization at the end of the\nath9k_htc_probe_device() and add helper macro to make\nall *_STAT_* macros NULL safe, since syzbot has reported related NULL\nderef in that macros [1]",
