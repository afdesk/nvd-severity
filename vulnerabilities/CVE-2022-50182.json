  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: imx-jpeg: Align upwards buffer size\n\nThe hardware can support any image size WxH,\nwith arbitrary W (image width) and H (image height) dimensions.\n\nAlign upwards buffer size for both encoder and decoder.\nand leave the picture resolution unchanged.\n\nFor decoder, the risk of memory out of bounds can be avoided.\nFor both encoder and decoder, the driver will lift the limitation of\nresolution alignment.\n\nFor example, the decoder can support jpeg whose resolution is 227x149\nthe encoder can support nv12 1080P, won't change it to 1920x1072.",
