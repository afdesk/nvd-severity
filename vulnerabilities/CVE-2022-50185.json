  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: fix potential buffer overflow in ni_set_mc_special_registers()\n\nThe last case label can write two buffers 'mc_reg_address[j]' and\n'mc_data[j]' with 'j' offset equal to SMC_NISLANDS_MC_REGISTER_ARRAY_SIZE\nsince there are no checks for this value in both case labels after the\nlast 'j++'.\n\nInstead of changing '>' to '>=' there, add the bounds check at the start\nof the second 'case' (the first one already has it).\n\nAlso, remove redundant last checks for 'j' index bigger than array size.\nThe expression is always false. Moreover, before or after the patch\n'table->last' can be equal to SMC_NISLANDS_MC_REGISTER_ARRAY_SIZE and it\nseems it can be a valid value.\n\nDetected using the static analysis tool - Svace.",
