  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nath11k: fix missing skb drop on htc_tx_completion error\n\nOn htc_tx_completion error the skb is not dropped. This is wrong since\nthe completion_handler logic expect the skb to be consumed anyway even\nwhen an error is triggered. Not freeing the skb on error is a memory\nleak since the skb won't be freed anywere else. Correctly free the\npacket on eid >= ATH11K_HTC_EP_COUNT before returning.\n\nTested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.5.0.1-01208-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
