  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix KASAN use-after-free Read in compute_effective_progs\n\nSyzbot found a Use After Free bug in compute_effective_progs().\nThe reproducer creates a number of BPF links, and causes a fault\ninjected alloc to fail, while calling bpf_link_detach on them.\nLink detach triggers the link to be freed by bpf_link_free(),\nwhich calls __cgroup_bpf_detach() and update_effective_progs().\nIf the memory allocation in this function fails, the function restores\nthe pointer to the bpf_cgroup_link on the cgroup list, but the memory\ngets freed just after it returns. After this, every subsequent call to\nupdate_effective_progs() causes this already deallocated pointer to be\ndereferenced in prog_list_length(), and triggers KASAN UAF error.\n\nTo fix this issue don't preserve the pointer to the prog or link in the\nlist, but remove it and replace it with a dummy prog without shrinking\nthe table. The subsequent call to __cgroup_bpf_detach() or\n__cgroup_bpf_detach() will correct it.",
