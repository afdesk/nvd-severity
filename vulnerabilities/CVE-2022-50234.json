  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/af_unix: defer registered files gc to io_uring release\n\nInstead of putting io_uring's registered files in unix_gc() we want it\nto be done by io_uring itself. The trick here is to consider io_uring\nregistered files for cycle detection but not actually putting them down.\nBecause io_uring can't register other ring instances, this will remove\nall refs to the ring file triggering the ->release path and clean up\nwith io_ring_ctx_free().\n\n[axboe: add kerneldoc comment to skb, fold in skb leak fix]",
