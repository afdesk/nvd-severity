  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl: fix possible null-ptr-deref in cxl_pci_init_afu|adapter()\n\nIf device_register() fails in cxl_pci_afu|adapter(), the device\nis not added, device_unregister() can not be called in the error\npath, otherwise it will cause a null-ptr-deref because of removing\nnot added device.\n\nAs comment of device_register() says, it should use put_device() to give\nup the reference in the error path. So split device_unregister() into\ndevice_del() and put_device(), then goes to put dev when register fails.",
