  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrapidio: fix possible UAF when kfifo_alloc() fails\n\nIf kfifo_alloc() fails in mport_cdev_open(), goto err_fifo and just free\npriv. But priv is still in the chdev->file_list, then list traversal\nmay cause UAF. This fixes the following smatch warning:\n\ndrivers/rapidio/devices/rio_mport_cdev.c:1930 mport_cdev_open() warn: '&priv->list' not removed from list",
