  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkprobes: Fix check for probe enabled in kill_kprobe()\n\nIn kill_kprobe(), the check whether disarm_kprobe_ftrace() needs to be\ncalled always fails. This is because before that we set the\nKPROBE_FLAG_GONE flag for kprobe so that \"!kprobe_disabled(p)\" is always\nfalse.\n\nThe disarm_kprobe_ftrace() call introduced by commit:\n\n  0cb2f1372baa (\"kprobes: Fix NULL pointer dereference at kprobe_ftrace_handler\")\n\nto fix the NULL pointer reference problem. When the probe is enabled, if\nwe do not disarm it, this problem still exists.\n\nFix it by putting the probe enabled check before setting the\nKPROBE_FLAG_GONE flag.",
