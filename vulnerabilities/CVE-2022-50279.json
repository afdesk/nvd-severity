  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtlwifi: Fix global-out-of-bounds bug in _rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit()\n\nThere is a global-out-of-bounds reported by KASAN:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in\n  _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte.part.0+0x3d/0x84 [rtl8821ae]\n  Read of size 1 at addr ffffffffa0773c43 by task NetworkManager/411\n\n  CPU: 6 PID: 411 Comm: NetworkManager Tainted: G      D\n  6.1.0-rc8+ #144 e15588508517267d37\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009),\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ...\n   kasan_report+0xbb/0x1c0\n   _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte.part.0+0x3d/0x84 [rtl8821ae]\n   rtl8821ae_phy_bb_config.cold+0x346/0x641 [rtl8821ae]\n   rtl8821ae_hw_init+0x1f5e/0x79b0 [rtl8821ae]\n   ...\n   </TASK>\n\nThe root cause of the problem is that the comparison order of\n\"prate_section\" in _rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit() is wrong. The\n_rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() is used to compare the first n bytes of the two\nstrings from tail to head, which causes the problem. In the\n_rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit(), it was originally intended to meet\nthis requirement by carefully designing the comparison order.\nFor example, \"pregulation\" and \"pbandwidth\" are compared in order of\nlength from small to large, first is 3 and last is 4. However, the\ncomparison order of \"prate_section\" dose not obey such order requirement,\ntherefore when \"prate_section\" is \"HT\", when comparing from tail to head,\nit will lead to access out of bounds in _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte(). As\nmentioned above, the _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() has the same function as\nstrcmp(), so just strcmp() is enough.\n\nFix it by removing _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() and use strcmp() barely.\nAlthough it can be fixed by adjusting the comparison order of\n\"prate_section\", this may cause the value of \"rate_section\" to not be\nfrom 0 to 5. In addition, commit \"21e4b0726dc6\" not only moved driver\nfrom staging to regular tree, but also added setting txpower limit\nfunction during the driver config phase, so the problem was introduced\nby this commit.",
