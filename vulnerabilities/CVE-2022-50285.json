  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm,hugetlb: take hugetlb_lock before decrementing h->resv_huge_pages\n\nThe h->*_huge_pages counters are protected by the hugetlb_lock, but\nalloc_huge_page has a corner case where it can decrement the counter\noutside of the lock.\n\nThis could lead to a corrupted value of h->resv_huge_pages, which we have\nobserved on our systems.\n\nTake the hugetlb_lock before decrementing h->resv_huge_pages to avoid a\npotential race.",
