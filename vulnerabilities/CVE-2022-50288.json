  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nqlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure\n\nadapter->dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in\ncase qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error, which always happens\nunder OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both\nof the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained\npointer, which is potentially freed at that point.\n\nPropagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable(), and instead free the dcb\npointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now\nunused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper, which was a simple wrapper around\nkfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE\nstatic analysis tool.",
