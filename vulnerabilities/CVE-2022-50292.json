  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dp: fix bridge lifetime\n\nDevice-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to\nthe lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be\nreleased when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.\n\nThis can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device\nwhen binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the\nresources is made.\n\nFor the DP bridges, previously allocated bridges will leak on probe\ndeferral.\n\nFix this by amending the DP parser interface and tying the lifetime of\nthe bridge device to the DRM device rather than DP platform device.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/502667/",
