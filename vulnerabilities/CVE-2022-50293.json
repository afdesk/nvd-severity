  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: do not BUG_ON() on ENOMEM when dropping extent items for a range\n\nIf we get -ENOMEM while dropping file extent items in a given range, at\nbtrfs_drop_extents(), due to failure to allocate memory when attempting to\nincrement the reference count for an extent or drop the reference count,\nwe handle it with a BUG_ON(). This is excessive, instead we can simply\nabort the transaction and return the error to the caller. In fact most\ncallers of btrfs_drop_extents(), directly or indirectly, already abort\nthe transaction if btrfs_drop_extents() returns any error.\n\nAlso, we already have error paths at btrfs_drop_extents() that may return\n-ENOMEM and in those cases we abort the transaction, like for example\nanything that changes the b+tree may return -ENOMEM due to a failure to\nallocate a new extent buffer when COWing an existing extent buffer, such\nas a call to btrfs_duplicate_item() for example.\n\nSo replace the BUG_ON() calls with proper logic to abort the transaction\nand return the error.",
