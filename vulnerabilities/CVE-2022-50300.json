  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix extent map use-after-free when handling missing device in read_one_chunk\n\nStore the error code before freeing the extent_map. Though it's\nreference counted structure, in that function it's the first and last\nallocation so this would lead to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThe error can happen eg. when chunk is stored on a missing device and\nthe degraded mount option is missing.\n\nBugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216721",
