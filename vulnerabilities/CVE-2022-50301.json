  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/omap: Fix buffer overflow in debugfs\n\nThere are two issues here:\n\n1) The \"len\" variable needs to be checked before the very first write.\n   Otherwise if omap2_iommu_dump_ctx() with \"bytes\" less than 32 it is a\n   buffer overflow.\n2) The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes that *would* have\n   been copied if there were enough space.  But we want to know the\n   number of bytes which were *actually* copied so use scnprintf()\n   instead.",
