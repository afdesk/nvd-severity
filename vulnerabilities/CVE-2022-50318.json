  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix reference count leak in hswep_has_limit_sbox()\n\npci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned\n'dev'. We need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count.\nSince 'dev' is only used in pci_read_config_dword(), let's add\npci_dev_put() right after it.",
