  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocxl: fix pci device refcount leak when calling get_function_0()\n\nget_function_0() calls pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(), as comment\nsays, it returns a pci device with refcount increment, so after\nusing it, pci_dev_put() needs be called.\n\nGet the device reference when get_function_0() is not called, so\npci_dev_put() can be called in the error path and callers\nunconditionally. And add comment above get_dvsec_vendor0() to tell\ncallers to call pci_dev_put().",
