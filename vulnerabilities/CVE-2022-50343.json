  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrapidio: fix possible name leaks when rio_add_device() fails\n\nPatch series \"rapidio: fix three possible memory leaks\".\n\nThis patchset fixes three name leaks in error handling.\n - patch #1 fixes two name leaks while rio_add_device() fails.\n - patch #2 fixes a name leak while  rio_register_mport() fails.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nIf rio_add_device() returns error, the name allocated by dev_set_name()\nneed be freed.  It should use put_device() to give up the reference in the\nerror path, so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup(), and the\n'rdev' can be freed in rio_release_dev().",
