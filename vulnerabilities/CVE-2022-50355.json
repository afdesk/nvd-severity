  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: vt6655: fix some erroneous memory clean-up loops\n\nIn some initialization functions of this driver, memory is allocated with\n'i' acting as an index variable and increasing from 0. The commit in\n\"Fixes\" introduces some clean-up codes in case of allocation failure,\nwhich free memory in reverse order with 'i' decreasing to 0. However,\nthere are some problems:\n  - The case i=0 is left out. Thus memory is leaked.\n  - In case memory allocation fails right from the start, the memory\n    freeing loops will start with i=-1 and invalid memory locations will\n    be accessed.\n\nOne of these loops has been fixed in commit c8ff91535880 (\"staging:\nvt6655: fix potential memory leak\"). Fix the remaining erroneous loops.",
