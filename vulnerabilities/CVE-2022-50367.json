  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: fix UAF/GPF bug in nilfs_mdt_destroy\n\nIn alloc_inode, inode_init_always() could return -ENOMEM if\nsecurity_inode_alloc() fails, which causes inode->i_private\nuninitialized. Then nilfs_is_metadata_file_inode() returns\ntrue and nilfs_free_inode() wrongly calls nilfs_mdt_destroy(),\nwhich frees the uninitialized inode->i_private\nand leads to crashes(e.g., UAF/GPF).\n\nFix this by moving security_inode_alloc just prior to\nthis_cpu_inc(nr_inodes)",
