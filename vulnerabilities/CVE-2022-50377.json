  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: check and assert if marking an no_delete evicting inode dirty\n\nIn ext4_evict_inode(), if we evicting an inode in the 'no_delete' path,\nit cannot be raced by another mark_inode_dirty(). If it happens,\nsomeone else may accidentally dirty it without holding inode refcount\nand probably cause use-after-free issues in the writeback procedure.\nIt's indiscoverable and hard to debug, so add an WARN_ON_ONCE() to\ncheck and detect this issue in advance.",
