  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npadata: Always leave BHs disabled when running ->parallel()\n\nA deadlock can happen when an overloaded system runs ->parallel() in the\ncontext of the current task:\n\n    padata_do_parallel\n      ->parallel()\n        pcrypt_aead_enc/dec\n          padata_do_serial\n            spin_lock(&reorder->lock) // BHs still enabled\n              <interrupt>\n                ...\n                  __do_softirq\n                    ...\n                      padata_do_serial\n                        spin_lock(&reorder->lock)\n\nIt's a bug for BHs to be on in _do_serial as Steffen points out, so\nensure they're off in the \"current task\" case like they are in\npadata_parallel_worker to avoid this situation.",
