  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: hisilicon/qm - increase the memory of local variables\n\nIncrease the buffer to prevent stack overflow by fuzz test. The maximum\nlength of the qos configuration buffer is 256 bytes. Currently, the value\nof the 'val buffer' is only 32 bytes. The sscanf does not check the dest\nmemory length. So the 'val buffer' may stack overflow.",
