  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()\n\nA use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after a failing invocaion of\nacpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code\ninspection reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by\nacpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed on errors, but it is not popped\nfrom the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state()\ncalled by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new\nwalk state which is incorrect.\n\nTo address this, make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call\nacpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state from the thread before\nreturning an error.",
