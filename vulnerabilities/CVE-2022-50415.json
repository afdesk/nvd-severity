  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: led: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in start_task()\n\nstart_task() calls create_singlethread_workqueue() and not checked the\nret value, which may return NULL. And a null-ptr-deref may happen:\n\nstart_task()\n    create_singlethread_workqueue() # failed, led_wq is NULL\n    queue_delayed_work()\n        queue_delayed_work_on()\n            __queue_delayed_work()  # warning here, but continue\n                __queue_work()      # access wq->flags, null-ptr-deref\n\nCheck the ret value and return -ENOMEM if it is NULL.",
