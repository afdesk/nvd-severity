  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath11k: mhi: fix potential memory leak in ath11k_mhi_register()\n\nmhi_alloc_controller() allocates a memory space for mhi_ctrl. When gets\nsome error, mhi_ctrl should be freed with mhi_free_controller(). But\nwhen ath11k_mhi_read_addr_from_dt() fails, the function returns without\ncalling mhi_free_controller(), which will lead to a memory leak.\n\nWe can fix it by calling mhi_free_controller() when\nath11k_mhi_read_addr_from_dt() fails.",
