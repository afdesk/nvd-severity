  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix off-by-one errors in fast-commit block filling\n\nDue to several different off-by-one errors, or perhaps due to a late\nchange in design that wasn't fully reflected in the code that was\nactually merged, there are several very strange constraints on how\nfast-commit blocks are filled with tlv entries:\n\n- tlvs must start at least 10 bytes before the end of the block, even\n  though the minimum tlv length is 8.  Otherwise, the replay code will\n  ignore them.  (BUG: ext4_fc_reserve_space() could violate this\n  requirement if called with a len of blocksize - 9 or blocksize - 8.\n  Fortunately, this doesn't seem to happen currently.)\n\n- tlvs must end at least 1 byte before the end of the block.  Otherwise\n  the replay code will consider them to be invalid.  This quirk\n  contributed to a bug (fixed by an earlier commit) where uninitialized\n  memory was being leaked to disk in the last byte of blocks.\n\nAlso, strangely these constraints don't apply to the replay code in\ne2fsprogs, which will accept any tlvs in the blocks (with no bounds\nchecks at all, but that is a separate issue...).\n\nGiven that this all seems to be a bug, let's fix it by just filling\nblocks with tlv entries in the natural way.\n\nNote that old kernels will be unable to replay fast-commit journals\ncreated by kernels that have this commit.",
