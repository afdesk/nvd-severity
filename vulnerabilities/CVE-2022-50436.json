  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: don't set up encryption key during jbd2 transaction\n\nCommit a80f7fcf1867 (\"ext4: fixup ext4_fc_track_* functions' signature\")\nextended the scope of the transaction in ext4_unlink() too far, making\nit include the call to ext4_find_entry().  However, ext4_find_entry()\ncan deadlock when called from within a transaction because it may need\nto set up the directory's encryption key.\n\nFix this by restoring the transaction to its original scope.",
