  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfs: fix possible null-ptr-deref when parsing param\n\nAccording to commit \"vfs: parse: deal with zero length string value\",\nkernel will set the param->string to null pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string()\nif fs string has zero length.\n\nYet the problem is that, nfs_fs_context_parse_param() will dereferences the\nparam->string, without checking whether it is a null pointer, which may\ntrigger a null-ptr-deref bug.\n\nThis patch solves it by adding sanity check on param->string\nin nfs_fs_context_parse_param().",
