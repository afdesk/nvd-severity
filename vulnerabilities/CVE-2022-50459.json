  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Fix null-ptr-deref while calling getpeername()\n\nFix a NULL pointer crash that occurs when we are freeing the socket at the\nsame time we access it via sysfs.\n\nThe problem is that:\n\n 1. iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_get_param() and iscsi_sw_tcp_host_get_param() take\n    the frwd_lock and do sock_hold() then drop the frwd_lock. sock_hold()\n    does a get on the \"struct sock\".\n\n 2. iscsi_sw_tcp_release_conn() does sockfd_put() which does the last put\n    on the \"struct socket\" and that does __sock_release() which sets the\n    sock->ops to NULL.\n\n 3. iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_get_param() and iscsi_sw_tcp_host_get_param() then\n    call kernel_getpeername() which accesses the NULL sock->ops.\n\nAbove we do a get on the \"struct sock\", but we needed a get on the \"struct\nsocket\". Originally, we just held the frwd_lock the entire time but in\ncommit bcf3a2953d36 (\"scsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Avoid holding spinlock while\ncalling getpeername()\") we switched to refcount based because the network\nlayer changed and started taking a mutex in that path, so we could no\nlonger hold the frwd_lock.\n\nInstead of trying to maintain multiple refcounts, this just has us use a\nmutex for accessing the socket in the interface code paths.",
