  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmacintosh: fix possible memory leak in macio_add_one_device()\n\nAfer commit 1fa5ae857bb1 (\"driver core: get rid of struct device's\nbus_id string array\"), the name of device is allocated dynamically. It\nneeds to be freed when of_device_register() fails. Call put_device() to\ngive up the reference that's taken in device_initialize(), so that it\ncan be freed in kobject_cleanup() when the refcount hits 0.\n\nmacio device is freed in macio_release_dev(), so the kfree() can be\nremoved.",
