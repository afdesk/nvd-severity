  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nntb_netdev: Use dev_kfree_skb_any() in interrupt context\n\nTX/RX callback handlers (ntb_netdev_tx_handler(),\nntb_netdev_rx_handler()) can be called in interrupt\ncontext via the DMA framework when the respective\nDMA operations have completed. As such, any calls\nby these routines to free skb's, should use the\ninterrupt context safe dev_kfree_skb_any() function.\n\nPreviously, these callback handlers would call the\ninterrupt unsafe version of dev_kfree_skb(). This has\nnot presented an issue on Intel IOAT DMA engines as\nthat driver utilizes tasklets rather than a hard\ninterrupt handler, like the AMD PTDMA DMA driver.\nOn AMD systems, a kernel WARNING message is\nencountered, which is being issued from\nskb_release_head_state() due to in_hardirq()\nbeing true.\n\nBesides the user visible WARNING from the kernel,\nthe other symptom of this bug was that TCP/IP performance\nacross the ntb_netdev interface was very poor, i.e.\napproximately an order of magnitude below what was\nexpected. With the repair to use dev_kfree_skb_any(),\nkernel WARNINGs from skb_release_head_state() ceased\nand TCP/IP performance, as measured by iperf, was on\npar with expected results, approximately 20 Gb/s on\nAMD Milan based server. Note that this performance\nis comparable with Intel based servers.",
