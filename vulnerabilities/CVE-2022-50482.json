  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Clean up si_domain in the init_dmars() error path\n\nA splat from kmem_cache_destroy() was seen with a kernel prior to\ncommit ee2653bbe89d (\"iommu/vt-d: Remove domain and devinfo mempool\")\nwhen there was a failure in init_dmars(), because the iommu_domain\ncache still had objects. While the mempool code is now gone, there\nstill is a leak of the si_domain memory if init_dmars() fails. So\nclean up si_domain in the init_dmars() error path.",
