  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks\n\nWhen the driver hits -ENOMEM at allocating a URB or a buffer, it\naborts and goes to the error path that releases the all previously\nallocated resources.  However, when -ENOMEM hits at the middle of the\nsync EP URB allocation loop, the partially allocated URBs might be\nleft without released, because ep->nurbs is still zero at that point.\n\nFix it by setting ep->nurbs at first, so that the error handler loops\nover the full URB list.",
