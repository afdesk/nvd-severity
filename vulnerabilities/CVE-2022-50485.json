  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: add EXT4_IGET_BAD flag to prevent unexpected bad inode\n\nThere are many places that will get unhappy (and crash) when ext4_iget()\nreturns a bad inode. However, if iget the boot loader inode, allows a bad\ninode to be returned, because the inode may not be initialized. This\nmechanism can be used to bypass some checks and cause panic. To solve this\nproblem, we add a special iget flag EXT4_IGET_BAD. Only with this flag\nwe'd be returning bad inode from ext4_iget(), otherwise we always return\nthe error code if the inode is bad inode.(suggested by Jan Kara)",
