  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm: fix use-after-free on probe deferral\n\nThe bridge counter was never reset when tearing down the DRM device so\nthat stale pointers to deallocated structures would be accessed on the\nnext tear down (e.g. after a second late bind deferral).\n\nGiven enough bridges and a few probe deferrals this could currently also\nlead to data beyond the bridge array being corrupted.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/502665/",
