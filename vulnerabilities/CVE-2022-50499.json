  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: dvb-core: Fix double free in dvb_register_device()\n\nIn function dvb_register_device() -> dvb_register_media_device() ->\ndvb_create_media_entity(), dvb->entity is allocated and initialized. If\nthe initialization fails, it frees the dvb->entity, and return an error\ncode. The caller takes the error code and handles the error by calling\ndvb_media_device_free(), which unregisters the entity and frees the\nfield again if it is not NULL. As dvb->entity may not NULLed in\ndvb_create_media_entity() when the allocation of dvbdev->pad fails, a\ndouble free may occur. This may also cause an Use After free in\nmedia_device_unregister_entity().\n\nFix this by storing NULL to dvb->entity when it is freed.",
