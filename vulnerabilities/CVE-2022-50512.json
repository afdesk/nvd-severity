  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix potential memory leak in ext4_fc_record_regions()\n\nAs krealloc may return NULL, in this case 'state->fc_regions' may not be\nfreed by krealloc, but 'state->fc_regions' already set NULL. Then will\nlead to 'state->fc_regions' memory leak.",
