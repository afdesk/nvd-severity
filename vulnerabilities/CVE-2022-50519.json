  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: replace WARN_ONs by nilfs_error for checkpoint acquisition failure\n\nIf creation or finalization of a checkpoint fails due to anomalies in the\ncheckpoint metadata on disk, a kernel warning is generated.\n\nThis patch replaces the WARN_ONs by nilfs_error, so that a kernel, booted\nwith panic_on_warn, does not panic.  A nilfs_error is appropriate here to\nhandle the abnormal filesystem condition.\n\nThis also replaces the detected error codes with an I/O error so that\nneither of the internal error codes is returned to callers.",
