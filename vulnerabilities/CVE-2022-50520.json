  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: Fix PCI device refcount leak in radeon_atrm_get_bios()\n\nAs comment of pci_get_class() says, it returns a pci_device with its\nrefcount increased and decreased the refcount for the input parameter\n@from if it is not NULL.\n\nIf we break the loop in radeon_atrm_get_bios() with 'pdev' not NULL, we\nneed to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the refcount. Add the missing\npci_dev_put() to avoid refcount leak.",
