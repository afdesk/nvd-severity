  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Fix size validation for non-exclusive domains (v4)\n\nFix amdgpu_bo_validate_size() to check whether the TTM domain manager for the\nrequested memory exists, else we get a kernel oops when dereferencing \"man\".\n\nv2: Make the patch standalone, i.e. not dependent on local patches.\nv3: Preserve old behaviour and just check that the manager pointer is not\n    NULL.\nv4: Complain if GTT domain requested and it is uninitialized--most likely a\n    bug.",
