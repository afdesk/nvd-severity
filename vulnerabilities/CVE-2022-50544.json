  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: host: xhci: Fix potential memory leak in xhci_alloc_stream_info()\n\nxhci_alloc_stream_info() allocates stream context array for stream_info\n->stream_ctx_array with xhci_alloc_stream_ctx(). When some error occurs,\nstream_info->stream_ctx_array is not released, which will lead to a\nmemory leak.\n\nWe can fix it by releasing the stream_info->stream_ctx_array with\nxhci_free_stream_ctx() on the error path to avoid the potential memory\nleak.",
