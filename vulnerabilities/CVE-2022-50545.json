  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nr6040: Fix kmemleak in probe and remove\n\nThere is a memory leaks reported by kmemleak:\n\n  unreferenced object 0xffff888116111000 (size 2048):\n    comm \"modprobe\", pid 817, jiffies 4294759745 (age 76.502s)\n    hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n      00 c4 0a 04 81 88 ff ff 08 10 11 16 81 88 ff ff  ................\n      08 10 11 16 81 88 ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    backtrace:\n      [<ffffffff815bcd82>] kmalloc_trace+0x22/0x60\n      [<ffffffff827e20ee>] phy_device_create+0x4e/0x90\n      [<ffffffff827e6072>] get_phy_device+0xd2/0x220\n      [<ffffffff827e7844>] mdiobus_scan+0xa4/0x2e0\n      [<ffffffff827e8be2>] __mdiobus_register+0x482/0x8b0\n      [<ffffffffa01f5d24>] r6040_init_one+0x714/0xd2c [r6040]\n      ...\n\nThe problem occurs in probe process as follows:\n  r6040_init_one:\n    mdiobus_register\n      mdiobus_scan    <- alloc and register phy_device,\n                         the reference count of phy_device is 3\n    r6040_mii_probe\n      phy_connect     <- connect to the first phy_device,\n                         so the reference count of the first\n                         phy_device is 4, others are 3\n    register_netdev   <- fault inject succeeded, goto error handling path\n\n    // error handling path\n    err_out_mdio_unregister:\n      mdiobus_unregister(lp->mii_bus);\n    err_out_mdio:\n      mdiobus_free(lp->mii_bus);    <- the reference count of the first\n                                       phy_device is 1, it is not released\n                                       and other phy_devices are released\n  // similarly, the remove process also has the same problem\n\nThe root cause is traced to the phy_device is not disconnected when\nremoves one r6040 device in r6040_remove_one() or on error handling path\nafter r6040_mii probed successfully. In r6040_mii_probe(), a net ethernet\ndevice is connected to the first PHY device of mii_bus, in order to\nnotify the connected driver when the link status changes, which is the\ndefault behavior of the PHY infrastructure to handle everything.\nTherefore the phy_device should be disconnected when removes one r6040\ndevice or on error handling path.\n\nFix it by adding phy_disconnect() when removes one r6040 device or on\nerror handling path after r6040_mii probed successfully.",
