  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: solo6x10: fix possible memory leak in solo_sysfs_init()\n\nIf device_register() returns error in solo_sysfs_init(), the\nname allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed. As comment of\ndevice_register() says, it should use put_device() to give up\nthe reference in the error path. So fix this by calling\nput_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().",
