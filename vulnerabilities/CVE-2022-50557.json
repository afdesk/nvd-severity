  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinctrl: thunderbay: fix possible memory leak in thunderbay_build_functions()\n\nThe thunderbay_add_functions() will free memory of thunderbay_funcs\nwhen everything is ok, but thunderbay_funcs will not be freed when\nthunderbay_add_functions() fails, then there will be a memory leak,\nso we need to add kfree() when thunderbay_add_functions() fails to\nfix it.\n\nIn addition, doing some cleaner works, moving kfree(funcs) from\nthunderbay_add_functions() to thunderbay_build_functions().",
