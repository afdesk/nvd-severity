  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntpm: acpi: Call acpi_put_table() to fix memory leak\n\nThe start and length of the event log area are obtained from\nTPM2 or TCPA table, so we call acpi_get_table() to get the\nACPI information, but the acpi_get_table() should be coupled with\nacpi_put_table() to release the ACPI memory, add the acpi_put_table()\nproperly to fix the memory leak.\n\nWhile we are at it, remove the redundant empty line at the\nend of the tpm_read_log_acpi().",
