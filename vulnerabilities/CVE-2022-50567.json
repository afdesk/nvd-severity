  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: jfs: fix shift-out-of-bounds in dbAllocAG\n\nSyzbot found a crash : UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in dbAllocAG. The\nunderlying bug is the missing check of bmp->db_agl2size. The field can\nbe greater than 64 and trigger the shift-out-of-bounds.\n\nFix this bug by adding a check of bmp->db_agl2size in dbMount since this\nfield is used in many following functions. The upper bound for this\nfield is L2MAXL2SIZE - L2MAXAG, thanks for the help of Dave Kleikamp.\nNote that, for maintenance, I reorganized error handling code of dbMount.",
