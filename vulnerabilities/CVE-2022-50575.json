  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen/privcmd: Fix a possible warning in privcmd_ioctl_mmap_resource()\n\nAs 'kdata.num' is user-controlled data, if user tries to allocate\nmemory larger than(>=) MAX_ORDER, then kcalloc() will fail, it\ncreates a stack trace and messes up dmesg with a warning.\n\nCall trace:\n-> privcmd_ioctl\n--> privcmd_ioctl_mmap_resource\n\nAdd __GFP_NOWARN in order to avoid too large allocation warning.\nThis is detected by static analysis using smatch.",
