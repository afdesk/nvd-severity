  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: pch: Fix PCI device refcount leak in pch_request_dma()\n\nAs comment of pci_get_slot() says, it returns a pci_device with its\nrefcount increased. The caller must decrement the reference count by\ncalling pci_dev_put().\n\nSince 'dma_dev' is only used to filter the channel in filter(), we can\ncall pci_dev_put() before exiting from pch_request_dma(). Add the\nmissing pci_dev_put() for the normal and error path.",
