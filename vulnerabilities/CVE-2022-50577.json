  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: Fix memory leak in __ima_inode_hash()\n\nCommit f3cc6b25dcc5 (\"ima: always measure and audit files in policy\") lets\nmeasurement or audit happen even if the file digest cannot be calculated.\n\nAs a result, iint->ima_hash could have been allocated despite\nima_collect_measurement() returning an error.\n\nSince ima_hash belongs to a temporary inode metadata structure, declared\nat the beginning of __ima_inode_hash(), just add a kfree() call if\nima_collect_measurement() returns an error different from -ENOMEM (in that\ncase, ima_hash should not have been allocated).",
