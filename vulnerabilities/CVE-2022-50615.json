  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix reference count leak in snr_uncore_mmio_map()\n\npci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned\npci_dev, so snr_uncore_get_mc_dev() will return a pci_dev with its\nreference count increased. We need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the\nreference count. Let's add the missing pci_dev_put().",
