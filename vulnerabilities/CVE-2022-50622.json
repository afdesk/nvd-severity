  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix potential memory leak in ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()\n\nAs krealloc may return NULL, in this case 'state->fc_modified_inodes'\nmay not be freed by krealloc, but 'state->fc_modified_inodes' already\nset NULL. Then will lead to 'state->fc_modified_inodes' memory leak.",
