  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: hugetlb: fix UAF in hugetlb_handle_userfault\n\nThe vma_lock and hugetlb_fault_mutex are dropped before handling userfault\nand reacquire them again after handle_userfault(), but reacquire the\nvma_lock could lead to UAF[1,2] due to the following race,\n\nhugetlb_fault\n  hugetlb_no_page\n    /*unlock vma_lock */\n    hugetlb_handle_userfault\n      handle_userfault\n        /* unlock mm->mmap_lock*/\n                                           vm_mmap_pgoff\n                                             do_mmap\n                                               mmap_region\n                                                 munmap_vma_range\n                                                   /* clean old vma */\n        /* lock vma_lock again  <--- UAF */\n    /* unlock vma_lock */\n\nSince the vma_lock will unlock immediately after\nhugetlb_handle_userfault(), let's drop the unneeded lock and unlock in\nhugetlb_handle_userfault() to fix the issue.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/000000000000d5e00a05e834962e@google.com/\n[2] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20220921014457.1668-1-liuzixian4@huawei.com/",
