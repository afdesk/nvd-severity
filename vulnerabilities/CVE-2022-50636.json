  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: Fix pci_device_is_present() for VFs by checking PF\n\npci_device_is_present() previously didn't work for VFs because it reads the\nVendor and Device ID, which are 0xffff for VFs, which looks like they\naren't present.  Check the PF instead.\n\nWei Gong reported that if virtio I/O is in progress when the driver is\nunbound or \"0\" is written to /sys/.../sriov_numvfs, the virtio I/O\noperation hangs, which may result in output like this:\n\n  task:bash state:D stack:    0 pid: 1773 ppid:  1241 flags:0x00004002\n  Call Trace:\n   schedule+0x4f/0xc0\n   blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait+0x69/0xa0\n   blk_mq_freeze_queue+0x1b/0x20\n   blk_cleanup_queue+0x3d/0xd0\n   virtblk_remove+0x3c/0xb0 [virtio_blk]\n   virtio_dev_remove+0x4b/0x80\n   ...\n   device_unregister+0x1b/0x60\n   unregister_virtio_device+0x18/0x30\n   virtio_pci_remove+0x41/0x80\n   pci_device_remove+0x3e/0xb0\n\nThis happened because pci_device_is_present(VF) returned \"false\" in\nvirtio_pci_remove(), so it called virtio_break_device().  The broken vq\nmeant that vring_interrupt() skipped the vq.callback() that would have\ncompleted the virtio I/O operation via virtblk_done().\n\n[bhelgaas: commit log, simplify to always use pci_physfn(), add stable tag]",
