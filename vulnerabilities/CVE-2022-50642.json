  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: zero out stale pointers\n\n`cros_typec_get_switch_handles` allocates four pointers when obtaining\ntype-c switch handles. These pointers are all freed if failing to obtain\nany of them; therefore, pointers in `port` become stale. The stale\npointers eventually cause use-after-free or double free in later code\npaths. Zeroing out all pointer fields after freeing to eliminate these\nstale pointers.",
