  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: hpsa: Fix possible memory leak in hpsa_init_one()\n\nThe hpda_alloc_ctlr_info() allocates h and its field reply_map. However, in\nhpsa_init_one(), if alloc_percpu() failed, the hpsa_init_one() jumps to\nclean1 directly, which frees h and leaks the h->reply_map.\n\nFix by calling hpda_free_ctlr_info() to release h->replay_map and h instead\nfree h directly.",
