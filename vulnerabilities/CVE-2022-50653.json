  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmmc: atmel-mci: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()\n\nmmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value,\nit will lead two issues:\n1. The memory that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() is leaked.\n2. In the remove() path, mmc_remove_host() will be called to\n   delete device, but it's not added yet, it will lead a kernel\n   crash because of null-ptr-deref in device_del().\n\nSo fix this by checking the return value and calling mmc_free_host()\nin the error path.",
