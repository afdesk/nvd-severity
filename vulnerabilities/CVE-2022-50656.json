  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: pn533: Clear nfc_target before being used\n\nFix a slab-out-of-bounds read that occurs in nla_put() called from\nnfc_genl_send_target() when target->sensb_res_len, which is duplicated\nfrom an nfc_target in pn533, is too large as the nfc_target is not\nproperly initialized and retains garbage values. Clear nfc_targets with\nmemset() before they are used.\n\nFound by a modified version of syzkaller.\n\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in nla_put\nCall Trace:\n memcpy\n nla_put\n nfc_genl_dump_targets\n genl_lock_dumpit\n netlink_dump\n __netlink_dump_start\n genl_family_rcv_msg_dumpit\n genl_rcv_msg\n netlink_rcv_skb\n genl_rcv\n netlink_unicast\n netlink_sendmsg\n sock_sendmsg\n ____sys_sendmsg\n ___sys_sendmsg\n __sys_sendmsg\n do_syscall_64",
