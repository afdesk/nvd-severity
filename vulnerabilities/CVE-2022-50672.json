  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmailbox: zynq-ipi: fix error handling while device_register() fails\n\nIf device_register() fails, it has two issues:\n1. The name allocated by dev_set_name() is leaked.\n2. The parent of device is not NULL, device_unregister() is called\n   in zynqmp_ipi_free_mboxes(), it will lead a kernel crash because\n   of removing not added device.\n\nCall put_device() to give up the reference, so the name is freed in\nkobject_cleanup(). Add device registered check in zynqmp_ipi_free_mboxes()\nto avoid null-ptr-deref.",
