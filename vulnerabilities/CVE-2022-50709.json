  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath9k: avoid uninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()\n\nsyzbot is reporting uninit value at ath9k_htc_rx_msg() [1], for\nioctl(USB_RAW_IOCTL_EP_WRITE) can call ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() with\npkt_len = 0 but ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() uses\n__dev_alloc_skb(pkt_len + 32, GFP_ATOMIC) based on an assumption that\npkt_len is valid. As a result, ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() allocates skb\nwith uninitialized memory and ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is reading from\nuninitialized memory.\n\nSince bytes accessed by ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is not known until\nath9k_htc_rx_msg() is called, it would be difficult to check minimal valid\npkt_len at \"if (pkt_len > 2 * MAX_RX_BUF_SIZE) {\" line in\nath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().\n\nWe have two choices. One is to workaround by adding __GFP_ZERO so that\nath9k_htc_rx_msg() sees 0 if pkt_len is invalid. The other is to let\nath9k_htc_rx_msg() validate pkt_len before accessing. This patch chose\nthe latter.\n\nNote that I'm not sure threshold condition is correct, for I can't find\ndetails on possible packet length used by this protocol.",
