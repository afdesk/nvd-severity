  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: set tx_tstamps when creating new Tx rings via ethtool\n\nWhen the user changes the number of queues via ethtool, the driver\nallocates new rings. This allocation did not initialize tx_tstamps. This\nresults in the tx_tstamps field being zero (due to kcalloc allocation), and\nwould result in a NULL pointer dereference when attempting a transmit\ntimestamp on the new ring.",
