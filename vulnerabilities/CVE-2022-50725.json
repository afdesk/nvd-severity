  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: vidtv: Fix use-after-free in vidtv_bridge_dvb_init()\n\nKASAN reports a use-after-free:\nBUG: KASAN: use-after-free in dvb_dmxdev_release+0x4d5/0x5d0 [dvb_core]\nCall Trace:\n ...\n dvb_dmxdev_release+0x4d5/0x5d0 [dvb_core]\n vidtv_bridge_probe+0x7bf/0xa40 [dvb_vidtv_bridge]\n platform_probe+0xb6/0x170\n ...\nAllocated by task 1238:\n ...\n dvb_register_device+0x1a7/0xa70 [dvb_core]\n dvb_dmxdev_init+0x2af/0x4a0 [dvb_core]\n vidtv_bridge_probe+0x766/0xa40 [dvb_vidtv_bridge]\n ...\nFreed by task 1238:\n dvb_register_device+0x6d2/0xa70 [dvb_core]\n dvb_dmxdev_init+0x2af/0x4a0 [dvb_core]\n vidtv_bridge_probe+0x766/0xa40 [dvb_vidtv_bridge]\n ...\n\nIt is because the error handling in vidtv_bridge_dvb_init() is wrong.\n\nFirst, vidtv_bridge_dmx(dev)_init() will clean themselves when fail, but\ngoto fail_dmx(_dev): calls release functions again, which causes\nuse-after-free.\n\nAlso, in fail_fe, fail_tuner_probe and fail_demod_probe, j = i will cause\nout-of-bound when i finished its loop (i == NUM_FE). And the loop\nreleasing is wrong, although now NUM_FE is 1 so it won't cause problem.\n\nFix this by correctly releasing everything.",
