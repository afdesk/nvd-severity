  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: akcipher - default implementation for setting a private key\n\nChanges from v1:\n  * removed the default implementation from set_pub_key: it is assumed that\n    an implementation must always have this callback defined as there are\n    no use case for an algorithm, which doesn't need a public key\n\nMany akcipher implementations (like ECDSA) support only signature\nverifications, so they don't have all callbacks defined.\n\nCommit 78a0324f4a53 (\"crypto: akcipher - default implementations for\nrequest callbacks\") introduced default callbacks for sign/verify\noperations, which just return an error code.\n\nHowever, these are not enough, because before calling sign the caller would\nlikely call set_priv_key first on the instantiated transform (as the\nin-kernel testmgr does). This function does not have a default stub, so the\nkernel crashes, when trying to set a private key on an akcipher, which\ndoesn't support signature generation.\n\nI've noticed this, when trying to add a KAT vector for ECDSA signature to\nthe testmgr.\n\nWith this patch the testmgr returns an error in dmesg (as it should)\ninstead of crashing the kernel NULL ptr dereference.",
