  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/siw: Fix immediate work request flush to completion queue\n\nCorrectly set send queue element opcode during immediate work request\nflushing in post sendqueue operation, if the QP is in ERROR state.\nAn undefined ocode value results in out-of-bounds access to an array\nfor mapping the opcode between siw internal and RDMA core representation\nin work completion generation. It resulted in a KASAN BUG report\nof type 'global-out-of-bounds' during NFSoRDMA testing.\n\nThis patch further fixes a potential case of a malicious user which may\nwrite undefined values for completion queue elements status or opcode,\nif the CQ is memory mapped to user land. It avoids the same out-of-bounds\naccess to arrays for status and opcode mapping as described above.",
