  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath9k: hif_usb: fix memory leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs()\n\nSyzkaller reports a long-known leak of urbs in\nath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs().\n\nThe cause of the leak is that usb_get_urb() is called but usb_free_urb()\n(or usb_put_urb()) is not called inside usb_kill_urb() as urb->dev or\nurb->ep fields have not been initialized and usb_kill_urb() returns\nimmediately.\n\nThe patch removes trying to kill urbs located in hif_dev->tx.tx_buf\nbecause hif_dev->tx.tx_buf is not supposed to contain urbs which are in\npending state (the pending urbs are stored in hif_dev->tx.tx_pending).\nThe tx.tx_lock is acquired so there should not be any changes in the list.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
