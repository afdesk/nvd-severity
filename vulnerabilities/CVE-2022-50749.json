  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nacct: fix potential integer overflow in encode_comp_t()\n\nThe integer overflow is descripted with following codes:\n  > 317 static comp_t encode_comp_t(u64 value)\n  > 318 {\n  > 319         int exp, rnd;\n    ......\n  > 341         exp <<= MANTSIZE;\n  > 342         exp += value;\n  > 343         return exp;\n  > 344 }\n\nCurrently comp_t is defined as type of '__u16', but the variable 'exp' is\ntype of 'int', so overflow would happen when variable 'exp' in line 343 is\ngreater than 65535.",
