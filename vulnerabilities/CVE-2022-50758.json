  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: vt6655: fix potential memory leak\n\nIn function device_init_td0_ring, memory is allocated for member\ntd_info of priv->apTD0Rings[i], with i increasing from 0. In case of\nallocation failure, the memory is freed in reversed order, with i\ndecreasing to 0. However, the case i=0 is left out and thus memory is\nleaked.\n\nModify the memory freeing loop to include the case i=0.",
