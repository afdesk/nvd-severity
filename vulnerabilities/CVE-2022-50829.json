  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath9k: hif_usb: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb()\n\nIt is possible that skb is freed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg(), then\nusb_submit_urb() fails and we try to free skb again. It causes\nuse-after-free bug. Moreover, if alloc_skb() fails, urb->context becomes\nNULL but rx_buf is not freed and there can be a memory leak.\n\nThe patch removes unnecessary nskb and makes skb processing more clear: it\nis supposed that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees old skb or passes its\nmanaging to another callback function.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
