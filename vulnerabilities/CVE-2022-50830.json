  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nauxdisplay: hd44780: Fix potential memory leak in hd44780_remove()\n\nhd44780_probe() allocates a memory chunk for hd with kzalloc() and\nmakes \"lcd->drvdata->hd44780\" point to it. When we call hd44780_remove(),\nwe should release all relevant memory and resource. But \"lcd->drvdata\n->hd44780\" is not released, which will lead to a memory leak.\n\nWe should release the \"lcd->drvdata->hd44780\" in hd44780_remove() to fix\nthe memory leak bug.",
