  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njbd2: fix potential buffer head reference count leak\n\nAs in 'jbd2_fc_wait_bufs' if buffer isn't uptodate, will return -EIO without\nupdate 'journal->j_fc_off'. But 'jbd2_fc_release_bufs' will release buffer head\nfrom \u2018j_fc_off - 1\u2019 if 'bh' is NULL will terminal release which will lead to\nbuffer head buffer head reference count leak.\nTo solve above issue, update 'journal->j_fc_off' before return -EIO.",
