  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/a6xx: Fix kvzalloc vs state_kcalloc usage\n\nadreno_show_object() is a trap!  It will re-allocate the pointer it is\npassed on first call, when the data is ascii85 encoded, using kvmalloc/\nkvfree().  Which means the data *passed* to it must be kvmalloc'd, ie.\nwe cannot use the state_kcalloc() helper.\n\nThis partially reverts commit ec8f1813bf8d (\"drm/msm/a6xx: Replace\nkcalloc() with kvzalloc()\"), but adds the missing kvfree() to fix the\nmemory leak that was present previously.  And adds a warning comment.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/507014/",
