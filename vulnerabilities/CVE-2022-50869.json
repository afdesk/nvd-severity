  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in r_page\n\nWhen PAGE_SIZE is 64K, if read_log_page is called by log_read_rst for\nthe first time, the size of *buffer would be equal to\nDefaultLogPageSize(4K).But for *buffer operations like memcpy,\nif the memory area size(n) which being assigned to buffer is larger\nthan 4K (log->page_size(64K) or bytes(64K-page_off)), it will cause\nan out of boundary error.\n Call trace:\n  [...]\n  kasan_report+0x44/0x130\n  check_memory_region+0xf8/0x1a0\n  memcpy+0xc8/0x100\n  ntfs_read_run_nb+0x20c/0x460\n  read_log_page+0xd0/0x1f4\n  log_read_rst+0x110/0x75c\n  log_replay+0x1e8/0x4aa0\n  ntfs_loadlog_and_replay+0x290/0x2d0\n  ntfs_fill_super+0x508/0xec0\n  get_tree_bdev+0x1fc/0x34c\n  [...]\n\nFix this by setting variable r_page to NULL in log_read_rst.",
