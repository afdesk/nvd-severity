  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmmc: toshsd: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()\n\nmmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value, the memory\nthat allocated in mmc_alloc_host() will be leaked and it will lead a kernel\ncrash because of deleting not added device in the remove path.\n\nSo fix this by checking the return value and goto error path which will call\nmmc_free_host(), besides, free_irq() also needs be called.",
