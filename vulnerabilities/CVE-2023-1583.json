  "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference was found in io_file_bitmap_get in io_uring/filetable.c in the io_uring sub-component in the Linux Kernel. When fixed files are unregistered, some context information (file_alloc_{start,end} and alloc_hint) is not cleared. A subsequent request that has auto index selection enabled via IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC can cause a NULL pointer dereference. An unprivileged user can use the flaw to cause a system crash.",
