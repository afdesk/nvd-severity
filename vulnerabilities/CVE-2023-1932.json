  "Description": "A flaw was found in hibernate-validator's 'isValid' method in the org.hibernate.validator.internal.constraintvalidators.hv.SafeHtmlValidator class, which can be bypassed by omitting the tag ending in a less-than character. Browsers may render an invalid html, allowing HTML injection or Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) attacks.",
