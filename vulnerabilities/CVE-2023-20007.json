  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the web-based management process on the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker must have valid administrator credentials. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the web-based management process to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.",
