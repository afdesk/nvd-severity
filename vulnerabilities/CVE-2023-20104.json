This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an arbitrary file to a user and persuading that user to browse to a specific URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
