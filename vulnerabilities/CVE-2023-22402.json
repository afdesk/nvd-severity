  "Description": "A Use After Free vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In a Non Stop Routing (NSR) scenario, an unexpected kernel restart might be observed if \"bgp auto-discovery\" is enabled and if there is a BGP neighbor flap of auto-discovery sessions for any reason. This is a race condition which is outside of an attackers direct control and it depends on system internal timing whether this issue occurs. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-EVO; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R1-S1-EVO, 22.2R2-EVO.",
