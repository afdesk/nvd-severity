  "Description": "Izanami is a shared configuration service well-suited for micro-service architecture implementation. Attackers can bypass the authentication in this application when deployed using the official Docker image. Because a hard coded secret is used to sign the authentication token (JWT), an attacker could compromise another instance of Izanami. This issue has been patched in version 1.11.0.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
