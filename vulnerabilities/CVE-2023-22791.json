  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in Aruba InstantOS and ArubaOS 10\u00a0where an edge-case combination of network configuration, a\u00a0specific WLAN environment and an attacker already possessing\u00a0valid user credentials on that WLAN can lead to sensitive\u00a0information being disclosed via the WLAN. The scenarios in\u00a0which this disclosure of potentially sensitive information\u00a0can occur are complex and depend on factors that are beyond\u00a0the control of the attacker.",
