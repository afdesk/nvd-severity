  "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 6.2, mm/memory-tiers.c misinterprets the alloc_memory_type return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually an error pointer). NOTE: this is disputed by third parties because there are no realistic cases in which a user can cause the alloc_memory_type error case to be reached.",
