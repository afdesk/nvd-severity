  "Description": "Kaspersky has fixed a security issue in Kaspersky Password Manager (KPM) for Windows that allowed a local user to recover the auto-filled credentials from a memory dump when the KPM extension for Google Chrome is used. To exploit the issue, an attacker must trick a user into visiting a login form of a website with the saved credentials, and the KPM extension must autofill these credentials. The attacker must then launch a malware module to steal those specific credentials.",
