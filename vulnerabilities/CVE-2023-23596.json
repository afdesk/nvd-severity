  "Description": "jc21 NGINX Proxy Manager through 2.9.19 allows OS command injection. When creating an access list, the backend builds an htpasswd file with crafted username and/or password input that is concatenated without any validation, and is directly passed to the exec command, potentially allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. NOTE: this is not part of any NGINX software shipped by F5.",
