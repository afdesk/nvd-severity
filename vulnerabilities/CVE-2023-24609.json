  "Description": "Matrix SSL 4.x through 4.6.0 and Rambus TLS Toolkit have a length-subtraction integer overflow for Client Hello Pre-Shared Key extension parsing in the TLS 1.3 server. An attacked device calculates an SHA-2 hash over at least 65 KB (in RAM). With a large number of crafted TLS messages, the CPU becomes heavily loaded. This occurs in tls13VerifyBinder and tls13TranscriptHashUpdate.",
