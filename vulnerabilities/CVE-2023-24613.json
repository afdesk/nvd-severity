  "Description": "The user interface of Array Networks AG Series and vxAG through 9.4.0.470 could allow a remote attacker to use the gdb tool to overwrite the backend function call stack after accessing the system with administrator privileges. A successful exploit could leverage this vulnerability in the backend binary file that handles the user interface to a cause denial of service attack. This is fixed in AG 9.4.0.481.",
