  "Description": "vBulletin before 5.6.9 PL1 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP request that triggers deserialization. This occurs because verify_serialized checks that a value is serialized by calling unserialize and then checking for errors. The fixed versions are 5.6.7 PL1, 5.6.8 PL1, and 5.6.9 PL1.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN"
