  "Description": "Gradio is an open-source Python library to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications. Versions prior to 3.13.1 contain Use of Hard-coded Credentials. When using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`), a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. This issue is patched in version 3.13.1, however, users are recommended to update to 3.19.1 or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested.",
