  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Hyundai Gen5W_L in-vehicle infotainment system AE_E_PE_EUR.S5W_L001.001.211214. The AppUpgrade binary file, which is used during the firmware installation process, can be modified by an attacker to bypass the version check in order to install any firmware version (e.g., newer, older, or customized). This indirectly allows an attacker to install custom firmware in the IVI system.",
