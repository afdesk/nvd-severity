  "Description": "Attackers with access to user accounts can inject arbitrary control characters to SIEVE mail-filter rules. This could be abused to access SIEVE extension that are not allowed by App Suite or to inject rules which would break per-user filter processing, requiring manual cleanup of such rules. We have added sanitization to all mail-filter APIs to avoid forwardning control characters to subsystems. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n",
