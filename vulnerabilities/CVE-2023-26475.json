  "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 2.3-milestone-1, the annotation displayer does not execute the content in a restricted context. This allows executing anything with the right of the author of any document by annotating the document. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10. There is no easy workaround except to upgrade.",
