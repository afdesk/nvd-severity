  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE LPE9403 (All versions < V2.1). The `i2c` mutex file is created with the permissions bits of `-rw-rw-rw-`. This file is used as a mutex for multiple applications interacting with i2c. This could allow an authenticated attacker with access to the SSH interface on the affected device to interfere with the integrity of the mutex and the data it protects.",
