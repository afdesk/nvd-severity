  "Description": "SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Web Services) - versions 420, 430, allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values as CMS parameters to perform lookups on the internal network which is otherwise not accessible externally. On successful exploitation, attacker can scan internal network to determine internal infrastructure for further attacks like remote file inclusion, retrieve server files, bypass firewall and force the vulnerable server to execute malicious requests, resulting in sensitive information disclosure. This causes limited impact on confidentiality of data.\n\n",
