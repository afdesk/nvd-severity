  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Faronics Insight 10.0.19045 on Windows. The Insight Teacher Console application allows unauthenticated attackers to view constantly updated screenshots of student desktops and to submit falsified screenshots on behalf of students. Attackers are able to view screenshots of student desktops without their consent. These screenshots may potentially contain sensitive/personal data. Attackers can also rapidly submit falsified images, hiding the actual contents of student desktops from the Teacher Console.",
