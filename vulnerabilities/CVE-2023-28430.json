This workflow runs the following step with data controlled by the comment `(${{ github.event.issue.title }} \u2013 the full title of the Issue)`, allowing an attacker to take over the GitHub Runner and run custom commands, potentially stealing any secret (if used), or altering the repository. This issue was found with CodeQL using javascript\u2019s Expression injection in Actions query. This issue has been addressed in the repositories github action. No actions are required by users.
