  "Description": "GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.83 and prior to versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7, a user who has the Technician profile could see and generate a Personal token for a Super-Admin. Using such token it is possible to negotiate a GLPI session and hijack the Super-Admin account, resulting in a Privilege Escalation. Versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7 contain a patch for this issue.",
