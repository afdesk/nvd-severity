  "Description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to bypass an integrity check. In a 6PE scenario and if an additional integrity check is configured, it will fail to drop specific malformed IPv6 packets, and then these packets will be forwarded to other connected networks. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to 19.3R3-S7; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S7; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S1, 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2.",
