  "Description": "There exists a vulnerability in source code transformer (exception sanitization logic) of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.15, allowing attackers to bypass `handleException()` and leak unsanitized host exceptions which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context. A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.16` of `vm2`.\n",
