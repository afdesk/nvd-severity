  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in libbzip3.a in bzip3 1.2.2. There is a bz3_decompress out-of-bounds read in certain situations where buffers passed to bzip3 do not contain enough space to be filled with decompressed data. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that the observed behavior can only occur for a contract violation, and thus the report is invalid.",
