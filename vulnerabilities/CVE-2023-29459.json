  "Description": "The laola.redbull application through 5.1.9-R for Android exposes the exported activity at.redbullsalzburg.android.AppMode.Default.Splash.SplashActivity, which accepts a data: URI. The target of this URI is subsequently loaded into the application's webview, thus allowing the loading of arbitrary content into the context of the application. This can occur via the fcrbs schema or an explicit intent invocation.",
