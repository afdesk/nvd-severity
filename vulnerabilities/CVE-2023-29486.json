  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Heimdal Thor agent versions 3.4.2 and before 3.7.0 on Windows, allows attackers to bypass USB access restrictions, execute arbitrary code, and obtain sensitive information via Next-Gen Antivirus component. NOTE: Heimdal argues that the limitation described here is a Microsoft Windows issue, not a Heimdal specific vulnerability. The USB control solution by Heimdal is meant to manage Microsoft Windows native USB restrictions. They maintain that their solution functions as a management layer over Windows settings and is not to blame for limitations in Windows' detection capabilities.",
