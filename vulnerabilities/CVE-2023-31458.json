  "Description": "A vulnerability in the Edge Gateway component of Mitel MiVoice Connect versions 19.3 SP2 (22.24.1500.0) and earlier could allow an unauthenticated attacker with internal network access to authenticate with administrative privileges, because initial installation does not enforce a password change. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to make arbitrary configuration changes and execute arbitrary commands.",
