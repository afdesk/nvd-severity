  "Description": "A flaw was found in the QEMU virtual crypto device while handling data encryption/decryption requests in virtio_crypto_handle_sym_req. There is no check for the value of `src_len` and `dst_len` in virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper, potentially leading to a heap buffer overflow when the two values differ.",
