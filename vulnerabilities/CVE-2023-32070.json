  "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to version 14.6-rc-1, HTML rendering didn't check for dangerous attributes/attribute values. This allowed cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via attributes and link URLs, e.g., supported in XWiki syntax. This has been patched in XWiki 14.6-rc-1. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a fixed version.",
