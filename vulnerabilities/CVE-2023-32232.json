  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Vasion PrinterLogic Client for Windows before 25.0.0.836. During client installation and repair, a PrinterLogic binary is called by the installer to configure the device. This window is not hidden, and is running with elevated privileges. A standard user can break out of this window, obtaining a full SYSTEM command prompt window. This results in complete compromise via arbitrary SYSTEM code execution (elevation of privileges).",
