  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Veritas InfoScale Operations Manager (VIOM) before 7.4.2.800 and 8.x before 8.0.410. The VIOM web application does not validate user-supplied data and appends it to OS commands and internal binaries used by the application. An attacker with root/administrator level privileges can leverage this to read sensitive data stored on the servers, modify data or server configuration, and delete data or application configuration.",
