  "Description": "In the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing versions below 4.0.1, a user can insert potentially malicious JavaScript code into the app, which causes that code to run on the user\u2019s machine. The app itself does not contain the potentially malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser, and requires additional user interaction to trigger. The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability at will.",
