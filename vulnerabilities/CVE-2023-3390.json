  "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.\n\nMishandled error handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE makes it possible to use a dangling pointer in the same transaction causing a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit\u00a01240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97.",
