  "Description": "The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized decryption of private information in versions up to, and including, 5.5.0. This is due to the passphrase and iv being hardcoded in the 'pm_encrypt_decrypt_pass' function and used across all sites running the plugin. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions or above to decrypt and view users' passwords. If combined with another vulnerability, this can potentially grant lower-privileged users access to users' passwords.",
