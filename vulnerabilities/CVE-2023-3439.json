  "Description": "A flaw was found in the MCTP protocol in the Linux kernel. The function mctp_unregister() reclaims the device's relevant resource when a netcard detaches. However, a running routine may be unaware of this and cause the use-after-free of the mdev->addrs object, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
