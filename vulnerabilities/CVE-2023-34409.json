  "Description": "In Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) server 2.x before 2.37.1, the authenticate function in auth_server.go does not properly formalize and sanitize URL paths to reject path traversal attempts. This allows an unauthenticated remote user, when a crafted POST request is made against unauthenticated API routes, to access otherwise protected API routes leading to escalation of privileges and information disclosure.",
