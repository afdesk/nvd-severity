  "Description": "\nAll versions of GE Digital CIMPLICITY that are not adhering to SDG guidance and accepting documents from untrusted sources are vulnerable to memory corruption issues due to insufficient input validation, including issues such as out-of-bounds reads and writes, use-after-free, stack-based buffer overflows, uninitialized pointers, and a heap-based buffer overflow. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n",
