  "Description": "The WireGuard client 0.5.3 on Windows insecurely configures the operating system and firewall such that traffic to a local network that uses non-RFC1918 IP addresses is blocked. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into blocking IP traffic to selected IP addresses and services even while the VPN is enabled. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to \"LocalNet attack resulting in the blocking of traffic\" rather than to only WireGuard.",
