  "Description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, gRPC access loggers using listener's global scope can cause a `use-after-free` crash when the listener is drained. Versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12 have a fix for this issue. As a workaround, disable gRPC access log or stop listener update.",
