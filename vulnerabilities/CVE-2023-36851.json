  "Description": "A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity.\n\n\n\nWith a specific request to \n\nwebauth_operation.php\n\nthat doesn't require authentication, an attacker is able to upload and download arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of \n\nintegrity\u00a0or confidentiality, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  \n\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S8;\n  *  21.4 \n\nversions prior to \n\n21.4R3-S6;\n  *  22.1 \n\nversions prior to \n\n22.1R3-S5;\n  *  22.2 \n\nversions prior to \n\n22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3 \n\nversions prior to \n\n22.3R3-S2;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22,4R2-S2, 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2 versions prior to \n\n23.2R1-S2,\u00a023.2R2.\n\n\n",
