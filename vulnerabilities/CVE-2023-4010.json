  "Description": "A flaw was found in the USB Host Controller Driver framework in the Linux kernel. The usb_giveback_urb function has a logic loophole in its implementation. Due to the inappropriate judgment condition of the goto statement, the function cannot return under the input of a specific malformed descriptor file, so it falls into an endless loop, resulting in a denial of service.",
