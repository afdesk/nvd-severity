  "Description": "phpPgAdmin 7.14.4 and earlier is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data which may lead to remote code execution because user-controlled data is directly passed to the PHP 'unserialize()' function in multiple places. An example is the functionality to manage tables in 'tables.php' where the 'ma[]' POST parameter is deserialized.",
