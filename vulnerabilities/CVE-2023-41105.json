  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Python 3.11 through 3.11.4. If a path containing '\\0' bytes is passed to os.path.normpath(), the path will be truncated unexpectedly at the first '\\0' byte. There are plausible cases in which an application would have rejected a filename for security reasons in Python 3.10.x or earlier, but that filename is no longer rejected in Python 3.11.x.",
