  "Description": "Moonlight-common-c contains the core GameStream client code shared between Moonlight clients. Moonlight-common-c is vulnerable to buffer overflow starting in commit 50c0a51b10ecc5b3415ea78c21d96d679e2288f9 due to unmitigated usage of unsafe C functions and improper bounds checking. A malicious game streaming server could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to crash a moonlight client, or achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the client (with insufficient exploit mitigations or if mitigations can be bypassed). The bug was addressed in commit 24750d4b748fefa03d09fcfd6d45056faca354e0.",
