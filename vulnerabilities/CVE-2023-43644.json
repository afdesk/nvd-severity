  "Description": "Sing-box is an open source proxy system. Affected versions are subject to an authentication bypass when specially crafted requests are sent to sing-box. This affects all SOCKS5 inbounds with user authentication and an attacker may be able to bypass authentication. Users are advised to update to sing-box 1.4.4 or to 1.5.0-rc.4. Users unable to update should not expose the SOCKS5 inbound to insecure environments.",
