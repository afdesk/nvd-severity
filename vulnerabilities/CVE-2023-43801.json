  "Description": "Arduino Create Agent is a package to help manage Arduino development. This vulnerability affects the endpoint `/v2/pkgs/tools/installed` and the way it handles plugin names supplied as user input. A user who has the ability to perform HTTP requests to the localhost interface, or is able to bypass the CORS configuration, can delete arbitrary files or folders belonging to the user that runs the Arduino Create Agent via a crafted HTTP DELETE request. This issue has been addressed in version `1.3.3`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n",
