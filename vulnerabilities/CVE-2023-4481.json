  "Description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen certain specific crafted BGP UPDATE messages are received over an established BGP session, one BGP session may be torn down with an UPDATE message error, or the issue may propagate beyond the local system which will remain non-impacted, but may affect one or more remote systems. This issue is exploitable remotely as the crafted UPDATE message can propagate through unaffected systems and intermediate BGP speakers.\nContinuous receipt of the crafted BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.\n\nThis issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.\n Improper Input Validation, Denial of Service vulnerability in Juniper Networks, Inc. Junos OS (BGP, rpd modules), Juniper Networks, Inc. Junos OS Evolved (BGP, rpd modules) allows Fuzzing.This issue affects\u00a0\n\nJunos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10,\n  *  from 21.1R1 through 21.*,\n  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S5,\n  *  from 21.3 before 21.3R3-S5,\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S7 (unaffected from 21.4R3-S5, affected from 21.4R3-S6)\n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4,\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S1,\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3,\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2.\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10-EVO,\n  *  from 21.2-EVO before 21.2R3-S7-EVO,\n  *  from 21.3-EVO before 21.3R3-S5-EVO,\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S5-EVO,\n  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S4-EVO,\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S1-EVO,\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.",
