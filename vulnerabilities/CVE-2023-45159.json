  "Description": "1E Client installer can perform arbitrary file deletion on protected files.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA non-privileged user could provide a symbolic link or Windows junction to point to a protected directory in the installer that the 1E Client would then clear on service startup. A hotfix is available Q23092 that forces\u00a0the 1E Client to check for a symbolic link or junction and if it finds one refuses to use that path and instead creates a path involving a random GUID.\n\n",
