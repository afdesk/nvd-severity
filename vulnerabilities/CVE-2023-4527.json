  "Description": "A flaw was found in glibc. When the getaddrinfo function is called with the AF_UNSPEC address family and the system is configured with no-aaaa mode via /etc/resolv.conf, a DNS response via TCP larger than 2048 bytes can potentially disclose stack contents through the function returned address data, and may cause a crash.",
