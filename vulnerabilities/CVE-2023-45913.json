  "Description": "Mesa v23.0.4 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the function dri2GetGlxDrawableFromXDrawableId(). This vulnerability is triggered when the X11 server sends an DRI2_BufferSwapComplete event unexpectedly when the application is using DRI3. NOTE: this is disputed because there is no scenario in which the vulnerability was demonstrated.",
