  "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nIf a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.",
