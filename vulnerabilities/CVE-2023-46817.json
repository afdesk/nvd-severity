The url request parameter passed to the /core/redirect route is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the unserialize() PHP function. This can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, allowing them to perform a variety of attacks, such as executing arbitrary PHP code.",
