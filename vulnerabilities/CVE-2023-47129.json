  "Description": "Statmic is a core Laravel content management system Composer package. Prior to versions 3.4.13 and 4.33.0, on front-end forms with an asset upload field, PHP files crafted to look like images may be uploaded. This only affects forms using the \"Forms\" feature and not just _any_ arbitrary form. This does not affect the control panel. This issue has been patched in 3.4.13 and 4.33.0.\n",
