  "Description": "For Kiuwan installations with SSO (single sign-on) enabled, an \nunauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting attack can be performed \non the login page \"login.html\". This is possible due to the request parameter \"message\" values\n being directly included in a JavaScript block in the response. This is \nespecially critical in business environments using AD SSO \nauthentication, e.g. via ADFS, where attackers could potentially steal \nAD passwords.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Kiuwan SAST: <master.1808.p685.q13371",
