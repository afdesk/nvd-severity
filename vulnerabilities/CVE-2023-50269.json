  "Description": "Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug in versions 2.6 through 2.7.STABLE9, versions 3.1 through 5.9, and versions 6.0.1 through 6.5, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Request parsing. This problem allows a remote client to perform Denial of Service attack by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header when the follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives.",
