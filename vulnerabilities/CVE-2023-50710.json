  "Description": "Hono is a web framework written in TypeScript. Prior to version 3.11.7, clients may override named path parameter values from previous requests if the application is using TrieRouter. So, there is a risk that a privileged user may use unintended parameters when deleting REST API resources. TrieRouter is used either explicitly or when the application matches a pattern that is not supported by the default RegExpRouter. Version 3.11.7 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, avoid using TrieRouter directly.",
