  "Description": "eProsima Fast DDS (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7, an invalid DATA_FRAG Submessage causes a bad-free error, and the Fast-DDS process can be remotely terminated. If an invalid Data_Frag packet is sent, the `Inline_qos, SerializedPayload` member of object `ch` will attempt to release memory without initialization, resulting in a 'bad-free' error. Versions 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.2, and 2.6.7 fix this issue.",
