  "Description": "The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the \"NSEC3\" issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations.",
