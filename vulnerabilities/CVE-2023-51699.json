  "Description": "Fluid is an open source Kubernetes-native Distributed Dataset Orchestrator and Accelerator for data-intensive applications. An OS command injection vulnerability within the Fluid project's JuicefsRuntime can potentially allow an authenticated user, who has the authority to create or update the K8s CRD Dataset/JuicefsRuntime, to execute arbitrary OS commands within the juicefs related containers. This could lead to unauthorized access, modification or deletion of data. Users who're using versions < 0.9.3 with JuicefsRuntime should upgrade to v0.9.3.",
