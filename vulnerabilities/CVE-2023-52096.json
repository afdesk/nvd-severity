  "Description": "SteVe Community ocpp-jaxb before 0.0.8 generates invalid timestamps such as ones with month 00 in certain situations (such as when an application receives a StartTransaction Open Charge Point Protocol message with a timestamp parameter of 1000000). This may lead to a SQL exception in applications, and may undermine the integrity of transaction records.",
