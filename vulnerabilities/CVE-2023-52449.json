  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmtd: Fix gluebi NULL pointer dereference caused by ftl notifier\n\nIf both ftl.ko and gluebi.ko are loaded, the notifier of ftl\ntriggers NULL pointer dereference when trying to access\n\u2018gluebi->desc\u2019 in gluebi_read().\n\nubi_gluebi_init\n  ubi_register_volume_notifier\n    ubi_enumerate_volumes\n      ubi_notify_all\n        gluebi_notify    nb->notifier_call()\n          gluebi_create\n            mtd_device_register\n              mtd_device_parse_register\n                add_mtd_device\n                  blktrans_notify_add   not->add()\n                    ftl_add_mtd         tr->add_mtd()\n                      scan_header\n                        mtd_read\n                          mtd_read_oob\n                            mtd_read_oob_std\n                              gluebi_read   mtd->read()\n                                gluebi->desc - NULL\n\nDetailed reproduction information available at the Link [1],\n\nIn the normal case, obtain gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(),\nand access gluebi->desc in the gluebi_read(). However,\ngluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in the\nftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThe solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBI\nvolume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].\nTherefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi from\ncreating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the\ntype MTD_UBIVOLUME.",
