  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length\n\nIf the host sends an H2CData command with an invalid DATAL,\nthe kernel may crash in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec().\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0000000000000000\nlr : nvmet_tcp_io_work+0x6ac/0x718 [nvmet_tcp]\nCall trace:\n  process_one_work+0x174/0x3c8\n  worker_thread+0x2d0/0x3e8\n  kthread+0x104/0x110\n\nFix the bug by raising a fatal error if DATAL isn't coherent\nwith the packet size.\nAlso, the PDU length should never exceed the MAXH2CDATA parameter which\nhas been communicated to the host in nvmet_tcp_handle_icreq().",
