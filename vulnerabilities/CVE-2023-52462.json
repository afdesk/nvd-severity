  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: fix check for attempt to corrupt spilled pointer\n\nWhen register is spilled onto a stack as a 1/2/4-byte register, we set\nslot_type[BPF_REG_SIZE - 1] (plus potentially few more below it,\ndepending on actual spill size). So to check if some stack slot has\nspilled register we need to consult slot_type[7], not slot_type[0].\n\nTo avoid the need to remember and double-check this in the future, just\nuse is_spilled_reg() helper.",
