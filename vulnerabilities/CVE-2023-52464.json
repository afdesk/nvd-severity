  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nEDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access\n\nEnabling -Wstringop-overflow globally exposes a warning for a common bug\nin the usage of strncat():\n\n  drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c: In function 'thunderx_ocx_com_threaded_isr':\n  drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c:1136:17: error: 'strncat' specified bound 1024 equals destination size [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]\n   1136 |                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);\n        |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n   ...\n   1145 |                                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);\n   ...\n   1150 |                                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);\n\n   ...\n\nApparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the\nway that strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer\nas its third argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The\nresult is that there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer.\n\nChange it to strlcat().\n\n  [ bp: Trim compiler output, fixup commit message. ]",
