  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table\n\nWhen ps allocated by kzalloc equals to NULL, kv_parse_power_table\nfrees adev->pm.dpm.ps that allocated before. However, after the control\nflow goes through the following call chains:\n\nkv_parse_power_table\n  |-> kv_dpm_init\n        |-> kv_dpm_sw_init\n\t      |-> kv_dpm_fini\n\nThe adev->pm.dpm.ps is used in the for loop of kv_dpm_fini after its\nfirst free in kv_parse_power_table and causes a use-after-free bug.",
