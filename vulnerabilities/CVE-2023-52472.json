  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: rsa - add a check for allocation failure\n\nStatic checkers insist that the mpi_alloc() allocation can fail so add\na check to prevent a NULL dereference.  Small allocations like this\ncan't actually fail in current kernels, but adding a check is very\nsimple and makes the static checkers happy.",
