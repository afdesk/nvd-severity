  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run\n\nIn mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with\nmtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.\n\nIn mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens in\nmtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while\nmark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.\n\nThere are two methods to trigger the bug. If we remove the\nmodule, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup.\nThe possible sequence is as follows, which will cause a\nuse-after-free bug.\n\nCPU0                  CPU1\nmtk_jpeg_dec_...    |\n  start worker\t    |\n                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work\nmtk_jpeg_remove     |\n  v4l2_m2m_release  |\n    kfree(m2m_dev); |\n                    |\n                    | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv\n                    |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use\n\nIf we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release,\nit will have a similar sequence.\n\nFix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec worker\nsuccessfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be called in\neither mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run.",
