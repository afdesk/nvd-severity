  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointer\n\nThough we do check the event ring read pointer by \"is_valid_ring_ptr\"\nto make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the\npointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elements\nare 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer\ncould lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption.\n\nSo add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.",
