When the flush is needed the code jumps\nout-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back to continue\nthe syscall return.\n\nHowever the branch back to label 1b doesn't return to the correct\nlocation, instead branching back just prior to the return to userspace,\ncausing bogus register values to be used by the rfi.\n\nThe breakage was introduced by commit 6f76a01173cc\n(\"powerpc/syscall: implement system call entry/exit logic in C for PPC32\") which\ninadvertently removed the \"1\" label and reused it elsewhere.\n\nFix it by adding named local labels in the correct locations. Note that\nthe return label needs to be outside the ifdef so that CONFIG_PPC_47x=n\ncompiles.",
