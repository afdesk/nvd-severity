  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-fc: Prevent null pointer dereference in nvme_fc_io_getuuid()\n\nThe nvme_fc_fcp_op structure describing an AEN operation is initialized with a\nnull request structure pointer. An FC LLDD may make a call to\nnvme_fc_io_getuuid passing a pointer to an nvmefc_fcp_req for an AEN operation.\n\nAdd validation of the request structure pointer before dereference.",
