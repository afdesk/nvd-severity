  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/srp: Do not call scsi_done() from srp_abort()\n\nAfter scmd_eh_abort_handler() has called the SCSI LLD eh_abort_handler\ncallback, it performs one of the following actions:\n* Call scsi_queue_insert().\n* Call scsi_finish_command().\n* Call scsi_eh_scmd_add().\nHence, SCSI abort handlers must not call scsi_done(). Otherwise all\nthe above actions would trigger a use-after-free. Hence remove the\nscsi_done() call from srp_abort(). Keep the srp_free_req() call\nbefore returning SUCCESS because we may not see the command again if\nSUCCESS is returned.",
