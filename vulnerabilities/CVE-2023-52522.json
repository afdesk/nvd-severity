  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix possible store tearing in neigh_periodic_work()\n\nWhile looking at a related syzbot report involving neigh_periodic_work(),\nI found that I forgot to add an annotation when deleting an\nRCU protected item from a list.\n\nReaders use rcu_deference(*np), we need to use either\nrcu_assign_pointer() or WRITE_ONCE() on writer side\nto prevent store tearing.\n\nI use rcu_assign_pointer() to have lockdep support,\nthis was the choice made in neigh_flush_dev().",
