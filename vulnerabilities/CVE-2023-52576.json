  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm, kexec, ima: Use memblock_free_late() from ima_free_kexec_buffer()\n\nThe code calling ima_free_kexec_buffer() runs long after the memblock\nallocator has already been torn down, potentially resulting in a use\nafter free in memblock_isolate_range().\n\nWith KASAN or KFENCE, this use after free will result in a BUG\nfrom the idle task, and a subsequent kernel panic.\n\nSwitch ima_free_kexec_buffer() over to memblock_free_late() to avoid\nthat bug.",
