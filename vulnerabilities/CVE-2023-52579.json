  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv4: fix null-deref in ipv4_link_failure\n\nCurrently, we assume the skb is associated with a device before calling\n__ip_options_compile, which is not always the case if it is re-routed by\nipvs.\nWhen skb->dev is NULL, dev_net(skb->dev) will become null-dereference.\nThis patch adds a check for the edge case and switch to use the net_device\nfrom the rtable when skb->dev is NULL.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN",
