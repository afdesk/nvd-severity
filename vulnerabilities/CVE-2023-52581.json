  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak when more than 255 elements expired\n\nWhen more than 255 elements expired we're supposed to switch to a new gc\ncontainer structure.\n\nThis never happens: u8 type will wrap before reaching the boundary\nand nft_trans_gc_space() always returns true.\n\nThis means we recycle the initial gc container structure and\nlose track of the elements that came before.\n\nWhile at it, don't deref 'gc' after we've passed it to call_rcu.",
