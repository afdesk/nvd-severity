  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: wfx: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in wfx_set_mfp_ap()\n\nSince 'ieee80211_beacon_get()' can return NULL, 'wfx_set_mfp_ap()'\nshould check the return value before examining skb data. So convert\nthe latter to return an appropriate error code and propagate it to\nreturn from 'wfx_start_ap()' as well. Compile tested only.",
