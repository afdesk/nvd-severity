  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsysctl: Fix out of bounds access for empty sysctl registers\n\nWhen registering tables to the sysctl subsystem there is a check to see\nif header is a permanently empty directory (used for mounts). This check\nevaluates the first element of the ctl_table. This results in an out of\nbounds evaluation when registering empty directories.\n\nThe function register_sysctl_mount_point now passes a ctl_table of size\n1 instead of size 0. It now relies solely on the type to identify\na permanently empty register.\n\nMake sure that the ctl_table has at least one element before testing for\npermanent emptiness.",
