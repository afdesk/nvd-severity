  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: fix uaf in jfs_evict_inode\n\nWhen the execution of diMount(ipimap) fails, the object ipimap that has been\nreleased may be accessed in diFreeSpecial(). Asynchronous ipimap release occurs\nwhen rcu_core() calls jfs_free_node().\n\nTherefore, when diMount(ipimap) fails, sbi->ipimap should not be initialized as\nipimap.",
