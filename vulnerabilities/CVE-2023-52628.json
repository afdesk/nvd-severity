  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nftables: exthdr: fix 4-byte stack OOB write\n\nIf priv->len is a multiple of 4, then dst[len / 4] can write past\nthe destination array which leads to stack corruption.\n\nThis construct is necessary to clean the remainder of the register\nin case ->len is NOT a multiple of the register size, so make it\nconditional just like nft_payload.c does.\n\nThe bug was added in 4.1 cycle and then copied/inherited when\ntcp/sctp and ip option support was added.\n\nBug reported by Zero Day Initiative project (ZDI-CAN-21950,\nZDI-CAN-21951, ZDI-CAN-21961).",
