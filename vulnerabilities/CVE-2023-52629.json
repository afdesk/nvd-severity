  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug\n\nThe original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()\nin switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop\nthe worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,\na use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:\n\n      (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)\nswitch_drv_remove()              |\n flush_work()                    |\n  ...                            |  switch_timer // timer\n                                 |   schedule_work(&psw->work)\n timer_shutdown_sync()           |\n ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker\n kfree(psw) // free              |\n                                 |   psw->state = 0 // use\n\nThis patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to\nmitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be\nstopped safely before the deallocate operations.",
