  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npmdomain: mediatek: fix race conditions with genpd\n\nIf the power domains are registered first with genpd and *after that*\nthe driver attempts to power them on in the probe sequence, then it is\npossible that a race condition occurs if genpd tries to power them on\nin the same time.\nThe same is valid for powering them off before unregistering them\nfrom genpd.\nAttempt to fix race conditions by first removing the domains from genpd\nand *after that* powering down domains.\nAlso first power up the domains and *after that* register them\nto genpd.",
