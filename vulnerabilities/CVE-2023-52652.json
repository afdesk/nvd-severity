  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNTB: fix possible name leak in ntb_register_device()\n\nIf device_register() fails in ntb_register_device(), the device name\nallocated by dev_set_name() should be freed. As per the comment in\ndevice_register(), callers should use put_device() to give up the\nreference in the error path. So fix this by calling put_device() in the\nerror path so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().\n\nAs a result of this, put_device() in the error path of\nntb_register_device() is removed and the actual error is returned.\n\n[mani: reworded commit message]",
