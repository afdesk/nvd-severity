  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/af_unix: disable sending io_uring over sockets\n\nFile reference cycles have caused lots of problems for io_uring\nin the past, and it still doesn't work exactly right and races with\nunix_stream_read_generic(). The safest fix would be to completely\ndisallow sending io_uring files via sockets via SCM_RIGHT, so there\nare no possible cycles invloving registered files and thus rendering\nSCM accounting on the io_uring side unnecessary.",
