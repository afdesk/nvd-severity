  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: fix a potential double-free in fs_any_create_groups\n\nWhen kcalloc() for ft->g succeeds but kvzalloc() for in fails,\nfs_any_create_groups() will free ft->g. However, its caller\nfs_any_create_table() will free ft->g again through calling\nmlx5e_destroy_flow_table(), which will lead to a double-free.\nFix this by setting ft->g to NULL in fs_any_create_groups().",
