  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/pm: fix a double-free in si_dpm_init\n\nWhen the allocation of\nadev->pm.dpm.dyn_state.vddc_dependency_on_dispclk.entries fails,\namdgpu_free_extended_power_table is called to free some fields of adev.\nHowever, when the control flow returns to si_dpm_sw_init, it goes to\nlabel dpm_failed and calls si_dpm_fini, which calls\namdgpu_free_extended_power_table again and free those fields again. Thus\na double-free is triggered.",
