  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/bridge: tpd12s015: Drop buggy __exit annotation for remove function\n\nWith tpd12s015_remove() marked with __exit this function is discarded\nwhen the driver is compiled as a built-in. The result is that when the\ndriver unbinds there is no cleanup done which results in resource\nleakage or worse.",
