  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: Intel: sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_common: ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL\n\nsof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() are used by different codecs, and some of\nthem use the same dai name.\nFor example, rt712 and rt713 both use \"rt712-sdca-aif1\" and\nsof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit().\nAs a result, sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() will be called twice by\nmc_dailink_exit_loop(). Set ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL; after\nput_device(ctx->headset_codec_dev); to avoid ctx->headset_codec_dev\nbeing put twice.",
