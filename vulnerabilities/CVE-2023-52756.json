  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npwm: Fix double shift bug\n\nThese enums are passed to set/test_bit().  The set/test_bit() functions\ntake a bit number instead of a shifted value.  Passing a shifted value\nis a double shift bug like doing BIT(BIT(1)).  The double shift bug\ndoesn't cause a problem here because we are only checking 0 and 1 but\nif the value was 5 or above then it can lead to a buffer overflow.",
