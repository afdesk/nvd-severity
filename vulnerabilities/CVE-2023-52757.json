If they don't, then an use-after-free bug\nwould have occurred anyways.\n\nBy getting rid of such spinlock also fixes a potential deadlock as\nshown below\n\nCPU 0                                CPU 1\n------------------------------------------------------------------\ncifs_demultiplex_thread()            cifs_debug_data_proc_show()\n release_mid()\n  spin_lock(&server->mid_lock);\n                                     spin_lock(&cifs_tcp_ses_lock)\n\t\t\t\t      spin_lock(&server->mid_lock)\n  __release_mid()\n   smb2_find_smb_tcon()\n    spin_lock(&cifs_tcp_ses_lock) *deadlock*",
