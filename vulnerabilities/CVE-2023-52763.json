  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: master: mipi-i3c-hci: Fix a kernel panic for accessing DAT_data.\n\nThe `i3c_master_bus_init` function may attach the I2C devices before the\nI3C bus initialization. In this flow, the DAT `alloc_entry`` will be used\nbefore the DAT `init`. Additionally, if the `i3c_master_bus_init` fails,\nthe DAT `cleanup` will execute before the device is detached, which will\nexecue DAT `free_entry` function. The above scenario can cause the driver\nto use DAT_data when it is NULL.",
