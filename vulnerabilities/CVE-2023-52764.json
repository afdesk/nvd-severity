  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: gspca: cpia1: shift-out-of-bounds in set_flicker\n\nSyzkaller reported the following issue:\nUBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/media/usb/gspca/cpia1.c:1031:27\nshift exponent 245 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'\n\nWhen the value of the variable \"sd->params.exposure.gain\" exceeds the\nnumber of bits in an integer, a shift-out-of-bounds error is reported. It\nis triggered because the variable \"currentexp\" cannot be left-shifted by\nmore than the number of bits in an integer. In order to avoid invalid\nrange during left-shift, the conditional expression is added.",
