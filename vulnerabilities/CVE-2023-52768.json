  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: wilc1000: use vmm_table as array in wilc struct\n\nEnabling KASAN and running some iperf tests raises some memory issues with\nvmm_table:\n\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in wilc_wlan_handle_txq+0x6ac/0xdb4\nWrite of size 4 at addr c3a61540 by task wlan0-tx/95\n\nKASAN detects that we are writing data beyond range allocated to vmm_table.\nThere is indeed a mismatch between the size passed to allocator in\nwilc_wlan_init, and the range of possible indexes used later: allocation\nsize is missing a multiplication by sizeof(u32)",
