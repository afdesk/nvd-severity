  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer()\n\nWhen ddc_service_construct() is called, it explicitly checks both the\nlink type and whether there is something on the link which will\ndictate whether the pin is marked as hw_supported.\n\nIf the pin isn't set or the link is not set (such as from\nunloading/reloading amdgpu in an IGT test) then fail the\namdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer() call.",
