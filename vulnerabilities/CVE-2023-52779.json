  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface function\n\nWhen vfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface function\nthen the 'nosec' should propagate into this function so that\nvfs_getattr_nosec() can again be called from the filesystem's gettattr\nrather than vfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary security\nchecks that the initial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid.\nTherefore, introduce the getattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass\nwith the new getattr_flags parameter to the getattr interface function.\nIn overlayfs and ecryptfs use this flag to determine which one of the\ntwo functions to call.\n\nIn a recent code change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up\ncalling vfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn called\nsecurity_inode_getattr() on an exiting process that did not have\ncurrent->fs set anymore, which then caused a kernel NULL pointer\ndereference. With this change the call to security_inode_getattr() can\nbe avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointer dereference.",
