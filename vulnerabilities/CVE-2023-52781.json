  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: config: fix iteration issue in 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()'\n\nThe BOS descriptor defines a root descriptor and is the base descriptor for\naccessing a family of related descriptors.\n\nFunction 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()' encounters an iteration issue when\nskipping the 'USB_DT_DEVICE_CAPABILITY' descriptor type. This results in\nthe same descriptor being read repeatedly.\n\nTo address this issue, a 'goto' statement is introduced to ensure that the\npointer and the amount read is updated correctly. This ensures that the\nfunction iterates to the next descriptor instead of reading the same\ndescriptor repeatedly.",
