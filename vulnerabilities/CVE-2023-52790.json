  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nswiotlb: fix out-of-bounds TLB allocations with CONFIG_SWIOTLB_DYNAMIC\n\nLimit the free list length to the size of the IO TLB. Transient pool can be\nsmaller than IO_TLB_SEGSIZE, but the free list is initialized with the\nassumption that the total number of slots is a multiple of IO_TLB_SEGSIZE.\nAs a result, swiotlb_area_find_slots() may allocate slots past the end of\na transient IO TLB buffer.",
