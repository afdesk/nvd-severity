  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool\n\nIn practice the driver should never send more commands than are allocated\nto a queue's event pool. In the unlikely event that this happens, the code\nasserts a BUG_ON, and in the case that the kernel is not configured to\ncrash on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event list\ncausing things to spiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact\nof the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed, and it is well known now that\nthe use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable\nscenario. There is nothing about this scenario that prevents the driver\nfrom recovering and carrying on.\n\nRemove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() and return a NULL\npointer in the case of an empty event pool. Update all call sites to\nibmvfc_get_event() to check for a NULL pointer and perfrom the appropriate\nfailure or recovery action.",
