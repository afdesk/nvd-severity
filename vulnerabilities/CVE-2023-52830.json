  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: Fix double free in hci_conn_cleanup\n\nsyzbot reports a slab use-after-free in hci_conn_hash_flush [1].\nAfter releasing an object using hci_conn_del_sysfs in the\nhci_conn_cleanup function, releasing the same object again\nusing the hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put functions causes a double free.\nHere's a simplified flow:\n\nhci_conn_del_sysfs:\n  hci_dev_put\n    put_device\n      kobject_put\n        kref_put\n          kobject_release\n            kobject_cleanup\n              kfree_const\n                kfree(name)\n\nhci_dev_put:\n  ...\n    kfree(name)\n\nhci_conn_put:\n  put_device\n    ...\n      kfree(name)\n\nThis patch drop the hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put function\ncall in hci_conn_cleanup function, because the object is\nfreed in hci_conn_del_sysfs function.\n\nThis patch also fixes the refcounting in hci_conn_add_sysfs() and\nhci_conn_del_sysfs() to take into account device_add() failures.\n\nThis fixes CVE-2023-28464.",
