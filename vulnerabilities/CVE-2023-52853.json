  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhid: cp2112: Fix duplicate workqueue initialization\n\nPreviously the cp2112 driver called INIT_DELAYED_WORK within\ncp2112_gpio_irq_startup, resulting in duplicate initilizations of the\nworkqueue on subsequent IRQ startups following an initial request. This\nresulted in a warning in set_work_data in workqueue.c, as well as a rare\nNULL dereference within process_one_work in workqueue.c.\n\nInitialize the workqueue within _probe instead.",
