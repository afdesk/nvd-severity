  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: can: j1939: enhanced error handling for tightly received RTS messages in xtp_rx_rts_session_new\n\nThis patch enhances error handling in scenarios with RTS (Request to\nSend) messages arriving closely. It replaces the less informative WARN_ON_ONCE\nbacktraces with a new error handling method. This provides clearer error\nmessages and allows for the early termination of problematic sessions.\nPreviously, sessions were only released at the end of j1939_xtp_rx_rts().\n\nPotentially this could be reproduced with something like:\ntestj1939 -r vcan0:0x80 &\nwhile true; do\n\t# send first RTS\n\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;\n\t# send second RTS\n\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;\n\t# send abort\n\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#ff00000000002301;\ndone",
