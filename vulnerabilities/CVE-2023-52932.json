  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/swapfile: add cond_resched() in get_swap_pages()\n\nThe softlockup still occurs in get_swap_pages() under memory pressure.  64\nCPU cores, 64GB memory, and 28 zram devices, the disksize of each zram\ndevice is 50MB with same priority as si.  Use the stress-ng tool to\nincrease memory pressure, causing the system to oom frequently.\n\nThe plist_for_each_entry_safe() loops in get_swap_pages() could reach tens\nof thousands of times to find available space (extreme case:\ncond_resched() is not called in scan_swap_map_slots()).  Let's add\ncond_resched() into get_swap_pages() when failed to find available space\nto avoid softlockup.",
