  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: multi-gen LRU: fix crash during cgroup migration\n\nlru_gen_migrate_mm() assumes lru_gen_add_mm() runs prior to itself.  This\nisn't true for the following scenario:\n\n    CPU 1                         CPU 2\n\n  clone()\n    cgroup_can_fork()\n                                cgroup_procs_write()\n    cgroup_post_fork()\n                                  task_lock()\n                                  lru_gen_migrate_mm()\n                                  task_unlock()\n    task_lock()\n    lru_gen_add_mm()\n    task_unlock()\n\nAnd when the above happens, kernel crashes because of linked list\ncorruption (mm_struct->lru_gen.list).",
