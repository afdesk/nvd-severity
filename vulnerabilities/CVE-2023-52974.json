  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: iscsi_tcp: Fix UAF during login when accessing the shost ipaddress\n\nIf during iscsi_sw_tcp_session_create() iscsi_tcp_r2tpool_alloc() fails,\nuserspace could be accessing the host's ipaddress attr. If we then free the\nsession via iscsi_session_teardown() while userspace is still accessing the\nsession we will hit a use after free bug.\n\nSet the tcp_sw_host->session after we have completed session creation and\ncan no longer fail.",
