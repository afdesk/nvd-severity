  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: dp83822: Fix null pointer access on DP83825/DP83826 devices\n\nThe probe() function is only used for the DP83822 PHY, leaving the\nprivate data pointer uninitialized for the smaller DP83825/26 models.\nWhile all uses of the private data structure are hidden in 82822 specific\ncallbacks, configuring the interrupt is shared across all models.\nThis causes a NULL pointer dereference on the smaller PHYs as it accesses\nthe private data unchecked. Verifying the pointer avoids that.",
