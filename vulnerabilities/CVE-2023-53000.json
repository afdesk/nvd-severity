  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetlink: prevent potential spectre v1 gadgets\n\nMost netlink attributes are parsed and validated from\n__nla_validate_parse() or validate_nla()\n\n    u16 type = nla_type(nla);\n\n    if (type == 0 || type > maxtype) {\n        /* error or continue */\n    }\n\n@type is then used as an array index and can be used\nas a Spectre v1 gadget.\n\narray_index_nospec() can be used to prevent leaking\ncontent of kernel memory to malicious users.\n\nThis should take care of vast majority of netlink uses,\nbut an audit is needed to take care of others where\nvalidation is not yet centralized in core netlink functions.",
