  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915: Fix a memory leak with reused mmap_offset\n\ndrm_vma_node_allow() and drm_vma_node_revoke() should be called in\nbalanced pairs. We call drm_vma_node_allow() once per-file everytime a\nuser calls mmap_offset, but only call drm_vma_node_revoke once per-file\non each mmap_offset. As the mmap_offset is reused by the client, the\nper-file vm_count may remain non-zero and the rbtree leaked.\n\nCall drm_vma_node_allow_once() instead to prevent that memory leak.",
