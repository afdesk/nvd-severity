  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: betop: check shape of output reports\n\nbetopff_init() only checks the total sum of the report counts for each\nreport field to be at least 4, but hid_betopff_play() expects 4 report\nfields.\nA device advertising an output report with one field and 4 report counts\nwould pass the check but crash the kernel with a NULL pointer dereference\nin hid_betopff_play().",
