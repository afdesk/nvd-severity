  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mdio: validate parameter addr in mdiobus_get_phy()\n\nThe caller may pass any value as addr, what may result in an out-of-bounds\naccess to array mdio_map. One existing case is stmmac_init_phy() that\nmay pass -1 as addr. Therefore validate addr before using it.",
