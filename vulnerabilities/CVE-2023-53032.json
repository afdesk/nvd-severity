  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: Fix overflow before widen in the bitmap_ip_create() function.\n\nWhen first_ip is 0, last_ip is 0xFFFFFFFF, and netmask is 31, the value of\nan arithmetic expression 2 << (netmask - mask_bits - 1) is subject\nto overflow due to a failure casting operands to a larger data type\nbefore performing the arithmetic.\n\nNote that it's harmless since the value will be checked at the next step.\n\nFound by InfoTeCS on behalf of Linux Verification Center\n(linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
