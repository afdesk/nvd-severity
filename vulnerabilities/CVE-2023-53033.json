  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nft_payload: incorrect arithmetics when fetching VLAN header bits\n\nIf the offset + length goes over the ethernet + vlan header, then the\nlength is adjusted to copy the bytes that are within the boundaries of\nthe vlan_ethhdr scratchpad area. The remaining bytes beyond ethernet +\nvlan header are copied directly from the skbuff data area.\n\nFix incorrect arithmetic operator: subtract, not add, the size of the\nvlan header in case of double-tagged packets to adjust the length\naccordingly to address CVE-2023-0179.",
