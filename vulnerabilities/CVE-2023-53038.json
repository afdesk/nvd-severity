  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Check kzalloc() in lpfc_sli4_cgn_params_read()\n\nIf kzalloc() fails in lpfc_sli4_cgn_params_read(), then we rely on\nlpfc_read_object()'s routine to NULL check pdata.\n\nCurrently, an early return error is thrown from lpfc_read_object() to\nprotect us from NULL ptr dereference, but the errno code is -ENODEV.\n\nChange the errno code to a more appropriate -ENOMEM.",
