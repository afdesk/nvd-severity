  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: ucsi: Fix NULL pointer deref in ucsi_connector_change()\n\nWhen ucsi_init() fails, ucsi->connector is NULL, yet in case of\nucsi_acpi we may still get events which cause the ucs_acpi code to call\nucsi_connector_change(), which then derefs the NULL ucsi->connector\npointer.\n\nFix this by not setting ucsi->ntfy inside ucsi_init() until ucsi_init()\nhas succeeded, so that ucsi_connector_change() ignores the events\nbecause UCSI_ENABLE_NTFY_CONNECTOR_CHANGE is not set in the ntfy mask.",
