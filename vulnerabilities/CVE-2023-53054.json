  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc2: fix a devres leak in hw_enable upon suspend resume\n\nEach time the platform goes to low power, PM suspend / resume routines\ncall: __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable -> devm_add_action_or_reset().\nThis adds a new devres each time.\nThis may also happen at runtime, as dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable() can be\ncalled from udc_start().\n\nThis can be seen with tracing:\n- echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/dev/devres_log/enable\n- go to low power\n- cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace\n\nA new \"ADD\" entry is found upon each low power cycle:\n... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 82a13bba devm_action_release (8 bytes)\n... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 49889daf devm_action_release (8 bytes)\n...\n\nA second issue is addressed here:\n- regulator_bulk_enable() is called upon each PM cycle (suspend/resume).\n- regulator_bulk_disable() never gets called.\n\nSo the reference count for these regulators constantly increase, by one\nupon each low power cycle, due to missing regulator_bulk_disable() call\nin __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable().\n\nThe original fix that introduced the devm_add_action_or_reset() call,\nfixed an issue during probe, that happens due to other errors in\ndwc2_driver_probe() -> dwc2_core_reset(). Then the probe fails without\ndisabling regulators, when dr_mode == USB_DR_MODE_PERIPHERAL.\n\nRather fix the error path: disable all the low level hardware in the\nerror path, by using the \"hsotg->ll_hw_enabled\" flag. Checking dr_mode\nhas been introduced to avoid a dual call to dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable().\n\"ll_hw_enabled\" should achieve the same (and is used currently in the\nremove() routine).",
