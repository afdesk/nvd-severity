  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: st-nci: Fix use after free bug in ndlc_remove due to race condition\n\nThis bug influences both st_nci_i2c_remove and st_nci_spi_remove.\nTake st_nci_i2c_remove as an example.\n\nIn st_nci_i2c_probe, it called ndlc_probe and bound &ndlc->sm_work\nwith llt_ndlc_sm_work.\n\nWhen it calls ndlc_recv or timeout handler, it will finally call\nschedule_work to start the work.\n\nWhen we call st_nci_i2c_remove to remove the driver, there\nmay be a sequence as follows:\n\nFix it by finishing the work before cleanup in ndlc_remove\n\nCPU0                  CPU1\n\n                    |llt_ndlc_sm_work\nst_nci_i2c_remove   |\n  ndlc_remove       |\n     st_nci_remove  |\n     nci_free_device|\n     kfree(ndev)    |\n//free ndlc->ndev   |\n                    |llt_ndlc_rcv_queue\n                    |nci_recv_frame\n                    |//use ndlc->ndev",
