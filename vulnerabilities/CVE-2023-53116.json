  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet: avoid potential UAF in nvmet_req_complete()\n\nAn nvme target ->queue_response() operation implementation may free the\nrequest passed as argument. Such implementation potentially could result\nin a use after free of the request pointer when percpu_ref_put() is\ncalled in nvmet_req_complete().\n\nAvoid such problem by using a local variable to save the sq pointer\nbefore calling __nvmet_req_complete(), thus avoiding dereferencing the\nreq pointer after that function call.",
