  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: core: Fix a procfs host directory removal regression\n\nscsi_proc_hostdir_rm() decreases a reference counter and hence must only be\ncalled once per host that is removed. This change does not require a\nscsi_add_host_with_dma() change since scsi_add_host_with_dma() will return\n0 (success) if scsi_proc_host_add() is called.",
