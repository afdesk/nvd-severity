  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: Fix deadlock during directory rename\n\nAs lockdep properly warns, we should not be locking i_rwsem while having\ntransactions started as the proper lock ordering used by all directory\nhandling operations is i_rwsem -> transaction start. Fix the lock\nordering by moving the locking of the directory earlier in\next4_rename().",
