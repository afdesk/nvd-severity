  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()\n\nIn dw2102_i2c_transfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf\nis null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would be\npassed. Malicious data finally reach dw2102_i2c_transfer. If accessing\nmsg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.\nWe add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.\n\nSimilar commit:\ncommit 950e252cb469\n(\"[media] dw2102: limit messages to buffer size\")",
