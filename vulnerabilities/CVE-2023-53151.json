  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes\n\nCurrently, there is no limit for raid1/raid10 plugged bio. While flushing\nwrites, raid1 has cond_resched() while raid10 doesn't, and too many\nwrites can cause soft lockup.\n\nFollow up soft lockup can be triggered easily with writeback test for\nraid10 with ramdisks:\n\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#10 stuck for 27s! [md0_raid10:1293]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n call_rcu+0x16/0x20\n put_object+0x41/0x80\n __delete_object+0x50/0x90\n delete_object_full+0x2b/0x40\n kmemleak_free+0x46/0xa0\n slab_free_freelist_hook.constprop.0+0xed/0x1a0\n kmem_cache_free+0xfd/0x300\n mempool_free_slab+0x1f/0x30\n mempool_free+0x3a/0x100\n bio_free+0x59/0x80\n bio_put+0xcf/0x2c0\n free_r10bio+0xbf/0xf0\n raid_end_bio_io+0x78/0xb0\n one_write_done+0x8a/0xa0\n raid10_end_write_request+0x1b4/0x430\n bio_endio+0x175/0x320\n brd_submit_bio+0x3b9/0x9b7 [brd]\n __submit_bio+0x69/0xe0\n submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x1e6/0x5a0\n submit_bio_noacct+0x38c/0x7e0\n flush_pending_writes+0xf0/0x240\n raid10d+0xac/0x1ed0\n\nFix the problem by adding cond_resched() to raid10 like what raid1 did.\n\nNote that unlimited plugged bio still need to be optimized, for example,\nin the case of lots of dirty pages writeback, this will take lots of\nmemory and io will spend a long time in plug, hence io latency is bad.",
