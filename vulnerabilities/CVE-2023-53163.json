  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: don't hold ni_lock when calling truncate_setsize()\n\nsyzbot is reporting hung task at do_user_addr_fault() [1], for there is\na silent deadlock between PG_locked bit and ni_lock lock.\n\nSince filemap_update_page() calls filemap_read_folio() after calling\nfolio_trylock() which will set PG_locked bit, ntfs_truncate() must not\ncall truncate_setsize() which will wait for PG_locked bit to be cleared\nwhen holding ni_lock lock.",
