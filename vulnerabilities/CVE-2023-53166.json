  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npower: supply: bq25890: Fix external_power_changed race\n\nbq25890_charger_external_power_changed() dereferences bq->charger,\nwhich gets sets in bq25890_power_supply_init() like this:\n\n  bq->charger = devm_power_supply_register(bq->dev, &bq->desc, &psy_cfg);\n\nAs soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()\nthe external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window\nwhere bq25890_charger_external_power_changed() may get called while\nbq->charger has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThis race hits during boot sometimes on a Lenovo Yoga Book 1 yb1-x90f\nwhen the cht_wcove_pwrsrc (extcon) power_supply is done with detecting\nthe connected charger-type which happens to exactly hit the small window:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n  <snip>\n  RIP: 0010:__power_supply_is_supplied_by+0xb/0xb0\n  <snip>\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   __power_supply_get_supplier_property+0x19/0x50\n   class_for_each_device+0xb1/0xe0\n   power_supply_get_property_from_supplier+0x2e/0x50\n   bq25890_charger_external_power_changed+0x38/0x1b0 [bq25890_charger]\n   __power_supply_changed_work+0x30/0x40\n   class_for_each_device+0xb1/0xe0\n   power_supply_changed_work+0x5f/0xe0\n  <snip>\n\nFixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed\nthe power_supply which will eventually get stored in bq->charger,\nso bq25890_charger_external_power_changed() can simply directly use\nthe passed in psy argument which is always valid.",
