  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Fix null pointer dereference in tracing_err_log_open()\n\nFix an issue in function 'tracing_err_log_open'.\nThe function doesn't call 'seq_open' if the file is opened only with\nwrite permissions, which results in 'file->private_data' being left as null.\nIf we then use 'lseek' on that opened file, 'seq_lseek' dereferences\n'file->private_data' in 'mutex_lock(&m->lock)', resulting in a kernel panic.\nWriting to this node requires root privileges, therefore this bug\nhas very little security impact.\n\nTracefs node: /sys/kernel/tracing/error_log\n\nExample Kernel panic:\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000038\nCall trace:\n mutex_lock+0x30/0x110\n seq_lseek+0x34/0xb8\n __arm64_sys_lseek+0x6c/0xb8\n invoke_syscall+0x58/0x13c\n el0_svc_common+0xc4/0x10c\n do_el0_svc+0x24/0x98\n el0_svc+0x24/0x88\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0x84/0xe4\n el0t_64_sync+0x1b4/0x1b8\nCode: d503201f aa0803e0 aa1f03e1 aa0103e9 (c8e97d02)\n---[ end trace 561d1b49c12cf8a5 ]---\nKernel panic - not syncing: Oops: Fatal exception",
