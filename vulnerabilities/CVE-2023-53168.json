  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: ucsi_acpi: Increase the command completion timeout\n\nCommit 130a96d698d7 (\"usb: typec: ucsi: acpi: Increase command\ncompletion timeout value\") increased the timeout from 5 seconds\nto 60 seconds due to issues related to alternate mode discovery.\n\nAfter the alternate mode discovery switch to polled mode\nthe timeout was reduced, but instead of being set back to\n5 seconds it was reduced to 1 second.\n\nThis is causing problems when using a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 yoga gen7\nconnected over Type-C to a LG 27UL850-W (charging DP over Type-C).\n\nWhen the monitor is already connected at boot the following error\nis logged: \"PPM init failed (-110)\", /sys/class/typec is empty and\non unplugging the NULL pointer deref fixed earlier in this series\nhappens.\n\nWhen the monitor is connected after boot the following error\nis logged instead: \"GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS failed (-110)\".\n\nSetting the timeout back to 5 seconds fixes both cases.",
