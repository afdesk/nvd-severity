  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/resctrl: Clear staged_config[] before and after it is used\n\nAs a temporary storage, staged_config[] in rdt_domain should be cleared\nbefore and after it is used. The stale value in staged_config[] could\ncause an MSR access error.\n\nHere is a reproducer on a system with 16 usable CLOSIDs for a 15-way L3\nCache (MBA should be disabled if the number of CLOSIDs for MB is less than\n16.) :\n\tmount -t resctrl resctrl -o cdp /sys/fs/resctrl\n\tmkdir /sys/fs/resctrl/p{1..7}\n\tumount /sys/fs/resctrl/\n\tmount -t resctrl resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl\n\tmkdir /sys/fs/resctrl/p{1..8}\n\nAn error occurs when creating resource group named p8:\n    unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0xca0 (tried to write 0x00000000000007ff) at rIP: 0xffffffff82249142 (cat_wrmsr+0x32/0x60)\n    Call Trace:\n     <IRQ>\n     __flush_smp_call_function_queue+0x11d/0x170\n     __sysvec_call_function+0x24/0xd0\n     sysvec_call_function+0x89/0xc0\n     </IRQ>\n     <TASK>\n     asm_sysvec_call_function+0x16/0x20\n\nWhen creating a new resource control group, hardware will be configured\nby the following process:\n    rdtgroup_mkdir()\n      rdtgroup_mkdir_ctrl_mon()\n        rdtgroup_init_alloc()\n          resctrl_arch_update_domains()\n\nresctrl_arch_update_domains() iterates and updates all resctrl_conf_type\nwhose have_new_ctrl is true. Since staged_config[] holds the same values as\nwhen CDP was enabled, it will continue to update the CDP_CODE and CDP_DATA\nconfigurations. When group p8 is created, get_config_index() called in\nresctrl_arch_update_domains() will return 16 and 17 as the CLOSIDs for\nCDP_CODE and CDP_DATA, which will be translated to an invalid register -\n0xca0 in this scenario.\n\nFix it by clearing staged_config[] before and after it is used.\n\n[reinette: re-order commit tags]",
