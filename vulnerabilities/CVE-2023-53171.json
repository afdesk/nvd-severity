  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/type1: prevent underflow of locked_vm via exec()\n\nWhen a vfio container is preserved across exec, the task does not change,\nbut it gets a new mm with locked_vm=0, and loses the count from existing\ndma mappings.  If the user later unmaps a dma mapping, locked_vm underflows\nto a large unsigned value, and a subsequent dma map request fails with\nENOMEM in __account_locked_vm.\n\nTo avoid underflow, grab and save the mm at the time a dma is mapped.\nUse that mm when adjusting locked_vm, rather than re-acquiring the saved\ntask's mm, which may have changed.  If the saved mm is dead, do nothing.\n\nlocked_vm is incremented for existing mappings in a subsequent patch.",
