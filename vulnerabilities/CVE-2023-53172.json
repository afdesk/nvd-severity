  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfsverity: reject FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY on mode 3 fds\n\nCommit 56124d6c87fd (\"fsverity: support enabling with tree block size <\nPAGE_SIZE\") changed FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY to use __kernel_read() to read\nthe file's data, instead of direct pagecache accesses.\n\nAn unintended consequence of this is that the\n'WARN_ON_ONCE(!(file->f_mode & FMODE_READ))' in __kernel_read() became\nreachable by fuzz tests.  This happens if FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY is called\non a fd opened with access mode 3, which means \"ioctl access only\".\n\nArguably, FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY should work on ioctl-only fds.  But\nioctl-only fds are a weird Linux extension that is rarely used and that\nfew people even know about.  (The documentation for FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY\neven specifically says it requires O_RDONLY.)  It's probably not\nworthwhile to make the ioctl internally open a new fd just to handle\nthis case.  Thus, just reject the ioctl on such fds for now.",
