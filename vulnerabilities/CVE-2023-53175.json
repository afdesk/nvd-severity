  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: hv: Fix a crash in hv_pci_restore_msi_msg() during hibernation\n\nWhen a Linux VM with an assigned PCI device runs on Hyper-V, if the PCI\ndevice driver is not loaded yet (i.e. MSI-X/MSI is not enabled on the\ndevice yet), doing a VM hibernation triggers a panic in\nhv_pci_restore_msi_msg() -> msi_lock_descs(&pdev->dev), because\npdev->dev.msi.data is still NULL.\n\nAvoid the panic by checking if MSI-X/MSI is enabled.",
