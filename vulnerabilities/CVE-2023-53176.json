  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: 8250: Reinit port->pm on port specific driver unbind\n\nWhen we unbind a serial port hardware specific 8250 driver, the generic\nserial8250 driver takes over the port. After that we see an oops about 10\nseconds later. This can produce the following at least on some TI SoCs:\n\nUnhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406)\nInternal error: : 1406 [#1] SMP ARM\n\nTurns out that we may still have the serial port hardware specific driver\nport->pm in use, and serial8250_pm() tries to call it after the port\nspecific driver is gone:\n\nserial8250_pm [8250_base] from uart_change_pm+0x54/0x8c [serial_base]\nuart_change_pm [serial_base] from uart_hangup+0x154/0x198 [serial_base]\nuart_hangup [serial_base] from __tty_hangup.part.0+0x328/0x37c\n__tty_hangup.part.0 from disassociate_ctty+0x154/0x20c\ndisassociate_ctty from do_exit+0x744/0xaac\ndo_exit from do_group_exit+0x40/0x8c\ndo_group_exit from __wake_up_parent+0x0/0x1c\n\nLet's fix the issue by calling serial8250_set_defaults() in\nserial8250_unregister_port(). This will set the port back to using\nthe serial8250 default functions, and sets the port->pm to point to\nserial8250_pm.",
