  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: add the missing IP_SET_HASH_WITH_NET0 macro for ip_set_hash_netportnet.c\n\nThe missing IP_SET_HASH_WITH_NET0 macro in ip_set_hash_netportnet can\nlead to the use of wrong `CIDR_POS(c)` for calculating array offsets,\nwhich can lead to integer underflow. As a result, it leads to slab\nout-of-bound access.\nThis patch adds back the IP_SET_HASH_WITH_NET0 macro to\nip_set_hash_netportnet to address the issue.",
