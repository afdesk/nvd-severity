  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndma-buf/dma-resv: Stop leaking on krealloc() failure\n\nCurrently dma_resv_get_fences() will leak the previously\nallocated array if the fence iteration got restarted and\nthe krealloc_array() fails.\n\nFree the old array by hand, and make sure we still clear\nthe returned *fences so the caller won't end up accessing\nfreed memory. Some (but not all) of the callers of\ndma_resv_get_fences() seem to still trawl through the\narray even when dma_resv_get_fences() failed. And let's\nzero out *num_fences as well for good measure.",
