  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: exit gracefully if reloc roots don't match\n\n[BUG]\nSyzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside\nprepare_to_merge().\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe root cause of the triggered ASSERT() is we can have a race between\nquota tree creation and relocation.\n\nThis leads us to create a duplicated quota tree in the\nbtrfs_read_fs_root() path, and since it's treated as fs tree, it would\nhave ROOT_SHAREABLE flag, causing us to create a reloc tree for it.\n\nThe bug itself is fixed by a dedicated patch for it, but this already\ntaught us the ASSERT() is not something straightforward for\ndevelopers.\n\n[ENHANCEMENT]\nInstead of using an ASSERT(), let's handle it gracefully and output\nextra info about the mismatch reloc roots to help debug.\n\nAlso with the above ASSERT() removed, we can trigger ASSERT(0)s inside\nmerge_reloc_roots() later.\nAlso replace those ASSERT(0)s with WARN_ON()s.",
