  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: minimal: fix potential memory leak in mlxsw_m_linecards_init\n\nThe line cards array is not freed in the error path of\nmlxsw_m_linecards_init(), which can lead to a memory leak. Fix by\nfreeing the array in the error path, thereby making the error path\nidentical to mlxsw_m_linecards_fini().",
