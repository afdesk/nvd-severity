  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted\n\nWhen sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection\nand channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling\ndata as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the\nconnection parameters.\n\nHowever, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned\nand further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is\nmade.\n\nFix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on\nEBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start\nthe call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an\noops may follow shortly thereafter.",
