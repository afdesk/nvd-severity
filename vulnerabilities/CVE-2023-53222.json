  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: jfs_dmap: Validate db_l2nbperpage while mounting\n\nIn jfs_dmap.c at line 381, BLKTODMAP is used to get a logical block\nnumber inside dbFree(). db_l2nbperpage, which is the log2 number of\nblocks per page, is passed as an argument to BLKTODMAP which uses it\nfor shifting.\n\nSyzbot reported a shift out-of-bounds crash because db_l2nbperpage is\ntoo big. This happens because the large value is set without any\nvalidation in dbMount() at line 181.\n\nThus, make sure that db_l2nbperpage is correct while mounting.\n\nMax number of blocks per page = Page size / Min block size\n=> log2(Max num_block per page) = log2(Page size / Min block size)\n\t\t\t\t= log2(Page size) - log2(Min block size)\n\n=> Max db_l2nbperpage = L2PSIZE - L2MINBLOCKSIZE",
