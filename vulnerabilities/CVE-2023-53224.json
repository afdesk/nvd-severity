  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: Fix function prototype mismatch for ext4_feat_ktype\n\nWith clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),\nindirect call targets are validated against the expected function\npointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate\nROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,\nwhich manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.\n\next4_feat_ktype was setting the \"release\" handler to \"kfree\", which\ndoesn't have a matching function prototype. Add a simple wrapper\nwith the correct prototype.\n\nThis was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict\nflag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,\nwhich only checks for type width mismatches.\n\nNote that this code is only reached when ext4 is a loadable module and\nit is being unloaded:\n\n CFI failure at kobject_put+0xbb/0x1b0 (target: kfree+0x0/0x180; expected type: 0x7c4aa698)\n ...\n RIP: 0010:kobject_put+0xbb/0x1b0\n ...\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  ext4_exit_sysfs+0x14/0x60 [ext4]\n  cleanup_module+0x67/0xedb [ext4]",
