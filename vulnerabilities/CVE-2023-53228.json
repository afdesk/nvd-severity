  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: drop redundant sched job cleanup when cs is aborted\n\nOnce command submission failed due to userptr invalidation in\namdgpu_cs_submit, legacy code will perform cleanup of scheduler\njob. However, it's not needed at all, as former commit has integrated\njob cleanup stuff into amdgpu_job_free. Otherwise, because of double\nfree, a NULL pointer dereference will occur in such scenario.\n\nBug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2457",
