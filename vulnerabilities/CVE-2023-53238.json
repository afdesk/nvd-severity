  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: hisilicon: Fix an out of bounds check in hisi_inno_phy_probe()\n\nThe size of array 'priv->ports[]' is INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM.\n\nIn the for loop, 'i' is used as the index for array 'priv->ports[]'\nwith a check (i > INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM) which indicates that\nINNO_PHY_PORT_NUM is allowed value for 'i' in the same loop.\n\nThis > comparison needs to be changed to >=, otherwise it potentially leads\nto an out of bounds write on the next iteration through the loop",
