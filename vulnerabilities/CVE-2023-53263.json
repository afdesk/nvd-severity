  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau/disp: fix use-after-free in error handling of nouveau_connector_create\n\nWe can't simply free the connector after calling drm_connector_init on it.\nWe need to clean up the drm side first.\n\nIt might not fix all regressions from commit 2b5d1c29f6c4\n(\"drm/nouveau/disp: PIOR DP uses GPIO for HPD, not PMGR AUX interrupts\"),\nbut at least it fixes a memory corruption in error handling related to\nthat commit.",
