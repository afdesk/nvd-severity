  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: imx: clk-imxrt1050: fix memory leak in imxrt1050_clocks_probe\n\nUse devm_of_iomap() instead of of_iomap() to automatically\nhandle the unused ioremap region. If any error occurs, regions allocated by\nkzalloc() will leak, but using devm_kzalloc() instead will automatically\nfree the memory using devm_kfree().\n\nAlso, fix error handling of hws by adding unregister_hws label, which\nunregisters remaining hws when iomap failed.",
