  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dpu: check for null return of devm_kzalloc() in dpu_writeback_init()\n\nBecause of the possilble failure of devm_kzalloc(), dpu_wb_conn might\nbe NULL and will cause null pointer dereference later.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to check it and directly return -ENOMEM.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/512277/\n[DB: fixed typo in commit message]",
