  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: add bounds checking in get_max_inline_xattr_value_size()\n\nNormally the extended attributes in the inode body would have been\nchecked when the inode is first opened, but if someone is writing to\nthe block device while the file system is mounted, it's possible for\nthe inode table to get corrupted.  Add bounds checking to avoid\nreading beyond the end of allocated memory if this happens.",
