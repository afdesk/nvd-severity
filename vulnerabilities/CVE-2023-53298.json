  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfc: fix memory leak of se_io context in nfc_genl_se_io\n\nThe callback context for sending/receiving APDUs to/from the selected\nsecure element is allocated inside nfc_genl_se_io and supposed to be\neventually freed in se_io_cb callback function. However, there are several\nerror paths where the bwi_timer is not charged to call se_io_cb later, and\nthe cb_context is leaked.\n\nThe patch proposes to free the cb_context explicitly on those error paths.\n\nAt the moment we can't simply check 'dev->ops->se_io()' return value as it\nmay be negative in both cases: when the timer was charged and was not.",
