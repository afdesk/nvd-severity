  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nft_set_rbtree: fix overlap expiration walk\n\nThe lazy gc on insert that should remove timed-out entries fails to release\nthe other half of the interval, if any.\n\nCan be reproduced with tests/shell/testcases/sets/0044interval_overlap_0\nin nftables.git and kmemleak enabled kernel.\n\nSecond bug is the use of rbe_prev vs. prev pointer.\nIf rbe_prev() returns NULL after at least one iteration, rbe_prev points\nto element that is not an end interval, hence it should not be removed.\n\nLastly, check the genmask of the end interval if this is active in the\ncurrent generation.",
