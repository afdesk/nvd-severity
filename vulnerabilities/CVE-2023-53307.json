  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrbd: avoid use-after-free in do_rbd_add() when rbd_dev_create() fails\n\nIf getting an ID or setting up a work queue in rbd_dev_create() fails,\nuse-after-free on rbd_dev->rbd_client, rbd_dev->spec and rbd_dev->opts\nis triggered in do_rbd_add().  The root cause is that the ownership of\nthese structures is transfered to rbd_dev prematurely and they all end\nup getting freed when rbd_dev_create() calls rbd_dev_free() prior to\nreturning to do_rbd_add().\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE, an\nincomplete patch submitted by Natalia Petrova <n.petrova@fintech.ru>.",
