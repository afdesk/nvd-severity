  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npower: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix external_power_changed race\n\nfuel_gauge_external_power_changed() dereferences info->bat,\nwhich gets sets in axp288_fuel_gauge_probe() like this:\n\n  info->bat = devm_power_supply_register(dev, &fuel_gauge_desc, &psy_cfg);\n\nAs soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()\nthe external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window\nwhere fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() may get called while\ninfo->bat has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed\nthe power_supply which will eventually get stored in info->bat,\nso fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() can simply directly use\nthe passed in psy argument which is always valid.",
