  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix use-after-free of nilfs_root in dirtying inodes via iput\n\nDuring unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after\nnilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  Previously,\nnilfs_evict_inode() could cause use-after-free read for nilfs_root if\ninodes are left in \"garbage_list\" and released by nilfs_dispose_list at\nthe end of nilfs_detach_log_writer(), and this bug was fixed by commit\n9b5a04ac3ad9 (\"nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in\nnilfs_evict_inode()\").\n\nHowever, it turned out that there is another possibility of UAF in the\ncall path where mark_inode_dirty_sync() is called from iput():\n\nnilfs_detach_log_writer()\n  nilfs_dispose_list()\n    iput()\n      mark_inode_dirty_sync()\n        __mark_inode_dirty()\n          nilfs_dirty_inode()\n            __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty()\n              nilfs_load_inode_block() --> causes UAF of nilfs_root struct\n\nThis can happen after commit 0ae45f63d4ef (\"vfs: add support for a\nlazytime mount option\"), which changed iput() to call\nmark_inode_dirty_sync() on its final reference if i_state has I_DIRTY_TIME\nflag and i_nlink is non-zero.\n\nThis issue appears after commit 28a65b49eb53 (\"nilfs2: do not write dirty\ndata after degenerating to read-only\") when using the syzbot reproducer,\nbut the issue has potentially existed before.\n\nFix this issue by adding a \"purging flag\" to the nilfs structure, setting\nthat flag while disposing the \"garbage_list\" and checking it in\n__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty().\n\nUnlike commit 9b5a04ac3ad9 (\"nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root\nin nilfs_evict_inode()\"), this patch does not rely on ns_writer to\ndetermine whether to skip operations, so as not to break recovery on\nmount.  The nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs routine dirties the buffer of\nsalvaged data before attaching the log writer, so changing\n__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() to skip the operation when ns_writer is NULL\nwill cause recovery write to fail.  The purpose of using the cleanup-only\nflag is to allow for narrowing of such conditions.",
