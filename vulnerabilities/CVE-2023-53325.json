  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: dp: Change logging to dev for mtk_dp_aux_transfer()\n\nChange logging from drm_{err,info}() to dev_{err,info}() in functions\nmtk_dp_aux_transfer() and mtk_dp_aux_do_transfer(): this will be\nessential to avoid getting NULL pointer kernel panics if any kind\nof error happens during AUX transfers happening before the bridge\nis attached.\n\nThis may potentially start happening in a later commit implementing\naux-bus support, as AUX transfers will be triggered from the panel\ndriver (for EDID) before the mtk-dp bridge gets attached, and it's\ndone in preparation for the same.",
