  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npstore/ram: Check start of empty przs during init\n\nAfter commit 30696378f68a (\"pstore/ram: Do not treat empty buffers as\nvalid\"), initialization would assume a prz was valid after seeing that\nthe buffer_size is zero (regardless of the buffer start position). This\nunchecked start value means it could be outside the bounds of the buffer,\nleading to future access panics when written to:\n\n sysdump_panic_event+0x3b4/0x5b8\n atomic_notifier_call_chain+0x54/0x90\n panic+0x1c8/0x42c\n die+0x29c/0x2a8\n die_kernel_fault+0x68/0x78\n __do_kernel_fault+0x1c4/0x1e0\n do_bad_area+0x40/0x100\n do_translation_fault+0x68/0x80\n do_mem_abort+0x68/0xf8\n el1_da+0x1c/0xc0\n __raw_writeb+0x38/0x174\n __memcpy_toio+0x40/0xac\n persistent_ram_update+0x44/0x12c\n persistent_ram_write+0x1a8/0x1b8\n ramoops_pstore_write+0x198/0x1e8\n pstore_console_write+0x94/0xe0\n ...\n\nTo avoid this, also check if the prz start is 0 during the initialization\nphase. If not, the next prz sanity check case will discover it (start >\nsize) and zap the buffer back to a sane state.\n\n[kees: update commit log with backtrace and clarifications]",
