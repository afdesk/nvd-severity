  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngenirq/ipi: Fix NULL pointer deref in irq_data_get_affinity_mask()\n\nIf ipi_send_{mask|single}() is called with an invalid interrupt number, all\nthe local variables there will be NULL. ipi_send_verify() which is invoked\nfrom these functions does verify its 'data' parameter, resulting in a\nkernel oops in irq_data_get_affinity_mask() as the passed NULL pointer gets\ndereferenced.\n\nAdd a missing NULL pointer check in ipi_send_verify()...\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static\nanalysis tool.",
