  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only\n\nAccording to syzbot's report, mark_buffer_dirty() called from\nnilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after\nnilfs2 detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.\n\nAfter such read-only degeneration, page cache data may be cleared through\nnilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate flag for their\nbuffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still\nperformed by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to\nbe called for buffer heads without the \"uptodate\" flag and causes the\nwarning.\n\nSince any writes should not be done to a read-only file system in the\nfirst place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty() by letting\nnilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.\n\nThis also changes the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid\nunnecessary log write retries if it detects -EROFS that\nnilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned.",
