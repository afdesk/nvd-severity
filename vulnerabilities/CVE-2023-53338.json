  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlwt: Fix return values of BPF xmit ops\n\nBPF encap ops can return different types of positive values, such like\nNET_RX_DROP, NET_XMIT_CN, NETDEV_TX_BUSY, and so on, from function\nskb_do_redirect and bpf_lwt_xmit_reroute. At the xmit hook, such return\nvalues would be treated implicitly as LWTUNNEL_XMIT_CONTINUE in\nip(6)_finish_output2. When this happens, skbs that have been freed would\ncontinue to the neighbor subsystem, causing use-after-free bug and\nkernel crashes.\n\nTo fix the incorrect behavior, skb_do_redirect return values can be\nsimply discarded, the same as tc-egress behavior. On the other hand,\nbpf_lwt_xmit_reroute returns useful errors to local senders, e.g. PMTU\ninformation. Thus convert its return values to avoid the conflict with\nLWTUNNEL_XMIT_CONTINUE.",
