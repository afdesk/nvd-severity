  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Collect command failures data only for known commands\n\nDEVX can issue a general command, which is not used by mlx5 driver.\nIn case such command is failed, mlx5 is trying to collect the failure\ndata, However, mlx5 doesn't create a storage for this command, since\nmlx5 doesn't use it. This lead to array-index-out-of-bounds error.\n\nFix it by checking whether the command is known before collecting the\nfailure data.",
