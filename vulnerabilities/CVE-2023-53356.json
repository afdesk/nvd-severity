  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: u_serial: Add null pointer check in gserial_suspend\n\nConsider a case where gserial_disconnect has already cleared\ngser->ioport. And if gserial_suspend gets called afterwards,\nit will lead to accessing of gser->ioport and thus causing\nnull pointer dereference.\n\nAvoid this by adding a null pointer check. Added a static\nspinlock to prevent gser->ioport from becoming null after\nthe newly added null pointer check.",
