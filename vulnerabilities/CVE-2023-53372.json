  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: fix a potential overflow in sctp_ifwdtsn_skip\n\nCurrently, when traversing ifwdtsn skips with _sctp_walk_ifwdtsn, it only\nchecks the pos against the end of the chunk. However, the data left for\nthe last pos may be < sizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip), and dereference\nit as struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip may cause coverflow.\n\nThis patch fixes it by checking the pos against \"the end of the chunk -\nsizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip)\" in sctp_ifwdtsn_skip, similar to\nsctp_fwdtsn_skip.",
