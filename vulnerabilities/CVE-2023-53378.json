  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/dpt: Treat the DPT BO as a framebuffer\n\nCurrently i915_gem_object_is_framebuffer() doesn't treat the\nBO containing the framebuffer's DPT as a framebuffer itself.\nThis means eg. that the shrinker can evict the DPT BO while\nleaving the actual FB BO bound, when the DPT is allocated\nfrom regular shmem.\n\nThat causes an immediate oops during hibernate as we\ntry to rewrite the PTEs inside the already evicted\nDPT obj.\n\nTODO: presumably this might also be the reason for the\nDPT related display faults under heavy memory pressure,\nbut I'm still not sure how that would happen as the object\nshould be pinned by intel_dpt_pin() while in active use by\nthe display engine...\n\n(cherry picked from commit 779cb5ba64ec7df80675a956c9022929514f517a)",
