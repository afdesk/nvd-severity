  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid10: fix null-ptr-deref of mreplace in raid10_sync_request\n\nThere are two check of 'mreplace' in raid10_sync_request(). In the first\ncheck, 'need_replace' will be set and 'mreplace' will be used later if\nno-Faulty 'mreplace' exists, In the second check, 'mreplace' will be\nset to NULL if it is Faulty, but 'need_replace' will not be changed\naccordingly. null-ptr-deref occurs if Faulty is set between two check.\n\nFix it by merging two checks into one. And replace 'need_replace' with\n'mreplace' because their values are always the same.",
