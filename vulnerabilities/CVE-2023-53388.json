  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: Clean dangling pointer on bind error path\n\nmtk_drm_bind() can fail, in which case drm_dev_put() is called,\ndestroying the drm_device object. However a pointer to it was still\nbeing held in the private object, and that pointer would be passed along\nto DRM in mtk_drm_sys_prepare() if a suspend were triggered at that\npoint, resulting in a panic. Clean the pointer when destroying the\nobject in the error path to prevent this from happening.",
