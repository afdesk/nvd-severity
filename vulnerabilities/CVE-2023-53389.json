However when the interrupts trigger the bridge\nmight not have been attached to a DRM device. As drm_helper_hpd_irq_event()\ndoes not check whether the passed in drm_device is valid or not, a NULL\npointer passed in results in a kernel NULL pointer dereference in it.\n\nCheck whether the bridge is attached and only trigger an HPD event if\nit is.",
