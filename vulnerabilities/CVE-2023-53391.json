  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nshmem: use ramfs_kill_sb() for kill_sb method of ramfs-based tmpfs\n\nAs the ramfs-based tmpfs uses ramfs_init_fs_context() for the\ninit_fs_context method, which allocates fc->s_fs_info, use ramfs_kill_sb()\nto free it and avoid a memory leak.",
