  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: xsk: Fix crash on regular rq reactivation\n\nWhen the regular rq is reactivated after the XSK socket is closed\nit could be reading stale cqes which eventually corrupts the rq.\nThis leads to no more traffic being received on the regular rq and a\ncrash on the next close or deactivation of the rq.\n\nKal Cuttler Conely reported this issue as a crash on the release\npath when the xdpsock sample program is stopped (killed) and restarted\nin sequence while traffic is running.\n\nThis patch flushes all cqes when during the rq flush. The cqe flushing\nis done in the reset state of the rq. mlx5e_rq_to_ready code is moved\ninto the flush function to allow for this.",
