  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nubifs: Fix memory leak in do_rename\n\nIf renaming a file in an encrypted directory, function\nfscrypt_setup_filename allocates memory for a file name. This name is\nnever used, and before returning to the caller the memory for it is not\nfreed.\n\nWhen running kmemleak on it we see that it is registered as a leak. The\nreport below is triggered by a simple program 'rename' that renames a\nfile in an encrypted directory:\n\n  unreferenced object 0xffff888101502840 (size 32):\n    comm \"rename\", pid 9404, jiffies 4302582475 (age 435.735s)\n    backtrace:\n      __kmem_cache_alloc_node\n      __kmalloc\n      fscrypt_setup_filename\n      do_rename\n      ubifs_rename\n      vfs_rename\n      do_renameat2\n\nTo fix this we can remove the call to fscrypt_setup_filename as it's not\nneeded.",
