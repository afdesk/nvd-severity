  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrcu: Protect rcu_print_task_exp_stall() ->exp_tasks access\n\nFor kernels built with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y, the following scenario can\nresult in a NULL-pointer dereference:\n\n           CPU1                                           CPU2\nrcu_preempt_deferred_qs_irqrestore                rcu_print_task_exp_stall\n  if (special.b.blocked)                            READ_ONCE(rnp->exp_tasks) != NULL\n    raw_spin_lock_rcu_node\n    np = rcu_next_node_entry(t, rnp)\n    if (&t->rcu_node_entry == rnp->exp_tasks)\n      WRITE_ONCE(rnp->exp_tasks, np)\n      ....\n      raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore_rcu_node\n                                                    raw_spin_lock_irqsave_rcu_node\n                                                    t = list_entry(rnp->exp_tasks->prev,\n                                                        struct task_struct, rcu_node_entry)\n                                                    (if rnp->exp_tasks is NULL, this\n                                                       will dereference a NULL pointer)\n\nThe problem is that CPU2 accesses the rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks\nfield without holding the rcu_node structure's ->lock and CPU2 did\nnot observe CPU1's change to rcu_node structure's ->exp_tasks in time.\nTherefore, if CPU1 sets rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks pointer to NULL,\nthen CPU2 might dereference that NULL pointer.\n\nThis commit therefore holds the rcu_node structure's ->lock while\naccessing that structure's->exp_tasks field.\n\n[ paulmck: Apply Frederic Weisbecker feedback. ]",
