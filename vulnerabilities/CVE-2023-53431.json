  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ses: Don't attach if enclosure has no components\n\nAn enclosure with no components can't usefully be operated by the driver\n(since effectively it has nothing to manage), so report the problem and\ndon't attach. Not attaching also fixes an oops which could occur if the\ndriver tries to manage a zero component enclosure.\n\n[mkp: Switched to KERN_WARNING since this scenario is common]",
