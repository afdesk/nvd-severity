  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: snic: Fix possible memory leak if device_add() fails\n\nIf device_add() returns error, the name allocated by dev_set_name() needs\nbe freed. As the comment of device_add() says, put_device() should be used\nto give up the reference in the error path. So fix this by calling\nput_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanp().",
