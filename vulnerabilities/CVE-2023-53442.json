  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: Block switchdev mode when ADQ is active and vice versa\n\nADQ and switchdev are not supported simultaneously. Enabling both at the\nsame time can result in nullptr dereference.\n\nTo prevent this, check if ADQ is active when changing devlink mode to\nswitchdev mode, and check if switchdev is active when enabling ADQ.",
