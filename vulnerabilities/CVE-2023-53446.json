  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to avoid use-after-free\n\nStruct pcie_link_state->downstream is a pointer to the pci_dev of function\n0.  Previously we retained that pointer when removing function 0, and\nsubsequent ASPM policy changes dereferenced it, resulting in a\nuse-after-free warning from KASAN, e.g.:\n\n  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:03:00.0/remove\n  # echo powersave > /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in pcie_config_aspm_link+0x42d/0x500\n  Call Trace:\n   kasan_report+0xae/0xe0\n   pcie_config_aspm_link+0x42d/0x500\n   pcie_aspm_set_policy+0x8e/0x1a0\n   param_attr_store+0x162/0x2c0\n   module_attr_store+0x3e/0x80\n\nPCIe spec r6.0, sec 7.5.3.7, recommends that software program the same ASPM\nControl value in all functions of multi-function devices.\n\nDisable ASPM and free the pcie_link_state when any child function is\nremoved so we can discard the dangling pcie_link_state->downstream pointer\nand maintain the same ASPM Control configuration for all functions.\n\n[bhelgaas: commit log and comment]",
