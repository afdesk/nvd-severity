  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: qla4xxx: Add length check when parsing nlattrs\n\nThere are three places that qla4xxx parses nlattrs:\n\n - qla4xxx_set_chap_entry()\n\n - qla4xxx_iface_set_param()\n\n - qla4xxx_sysfs_ddb_set_param()\n\nand each of them directly converts the nlattr to specific pointer of\nstructure without length checking. This could be dangerous as those\nattributes are not validated and a malformed nlattr (e.g., length 0) could\nresult in an OOB read that leaks heap dirty data.\n\nAdd the nla_len check before accessing the nlattr data and return EINVAL if\nthe length check fails.",
