  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: mcp-2221: prevent UAF in delayed work\n\nIf the device is plugged/unplugged without giving time for mcp_init_work()\nto complete, we might kick in the devm free code path and thus have\nunavailable struct mcp_2221 while in delayed work.\n\nCanceling the delayed_work item is enough to solve the issue, because\ncancel_delayed_work_sync will prevent the work item to requeue itself.",
