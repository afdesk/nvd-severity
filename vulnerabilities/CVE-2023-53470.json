  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nionic: catch failure from devlink_alloc\n\nAdd a check for NULL on the alloc return.  If devlink_alloc() fails and\nwe try to use devlink_priv() on the NULL return, the kernel gets very\nunhappy and panics. With this fix, the driver load will still fail,\nbut at least it won't panic the kernel.",
