  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/MCE/AMD: Use an u64 for bank_map\n\nThee maximum number of MCA banks is 64 (MAX_NR_BANKS), see\n\n  a0bc32b3cacf (\"x86/mce: Increase maximum number of banks to 64\").\n\nHowever, the bank_map which contains a bitfield of which banks to\ninitialize is of type unsigned int and that overflows when those bit\nnumbers are >= 32, leading to UBSAN complaining correctly:\n\n  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/amd.c:1365:38\n  shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'\n\nChange the bank_map to a u64 and use the proper BIT_ULL() macro when\nmodifying bits in there.\n\n  [ bp: Rewrite commit message. ]",
