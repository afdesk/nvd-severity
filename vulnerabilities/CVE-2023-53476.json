  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niw_cxgb4: Fix potential NULL dereference in c4iw_fill_res_cm_id_entry()\n\nThis condition needs to match the previous \"if (epcp->state == LISTEN) {\"\nexactly to avoid a NULL dereference of either \"listen_ep\" or \"ep\". The\nproblem is that \"epcp\" has been re-assigned so just testing\n\"if (epcp->state == LISTEN) {\" a second time is not sufficient.",
