  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries\n\nWhen calling irq_set_affinity_notifier() with NULL at the notify\nargument, it will cause freeing of the glue pointer in the\ncorresponding array entry but will leave the pointer in the array. A\nsubsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() will try to free this entry again\nleading to possible use after free.\n\nFix that by setting NULL to the array entry and checking that we have\nnon-zero at the array entry when iterating over the array in\nfree_irq_cpu_rmap().\n\nThe current code does not suffer from this since there are no cases\nwhere irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the\nnotify arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we\ndon't hit and issue. Subsequent patches in this series excersize this\nflow, hence the required fix.",
