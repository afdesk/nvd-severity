  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naccel/qaic: tighten bounds checking in decode_message()\n\nCopy the bounds checking from encode_message() to decode_message().\n\nThis patch addresses the following concerns.  Ensure that there is\nenough space for at least one header so that we don't have a negative\nsize later.\n\n\tif (msg_hdr_len < sizeof(*trans_hdr))\n\nEnsure that we have enough space to read the next header from the\nmsg->data.\n\n\tif (msg_len > msg_hdr_len - sizeof(*trans_hdr))\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\nCheck that the trans_hdr->len is not below the minimum size:\n\n\tif (hdr_len < sizeof(*trans_hdr))\n\nThis minimum check ensures that we don't corrupt memory in\ndecode_passthrough() when we do.\n\n\tmemcpy(out_trans->data, in_trans->data, len - sizeof(in_trans->hdr));\n\nAnd finally, use size_add() to prevent an integer overflow:\n\n\tif (size_add(msg_len, hdr_len) > msg_hdr_len)",
