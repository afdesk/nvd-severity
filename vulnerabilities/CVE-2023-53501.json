  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/amd/iommu_v2: Fix pasid_state refcount dec hit 0 warning on pasid unbind\n\nWhen unbinding pasid - a race condition exists vs outstanding page faults.\n\nTo prevent this, the pasid_state object contains a refcount.\n    * set to 1 on pasid bind\n    * incremented on each ppr notification start\n    * decremented on each ppr notification done\n    * decremented on pasid unbind\n\nSince refcount_dec assumes that refcount will never reach 0:\n  the current implementation causes the following to be invoked on\n  pasid unbind:\n        REFCOUNT_WARN(\"decrement hit 0; leaking memory\")\n\nFix this issue by changing refcount_dec to refcount_dec_and_test\nto explicitly handle refcount=1.",
