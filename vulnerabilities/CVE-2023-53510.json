  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: core: Fix handling of lrbp->cmd\n\nufshcd_queuecommand() may be called two times in a row for a SCSI command\nbefore it is completed. Hence make the following changes:\n\n - In the functions that submit a command, do not check the old value of\n   lrbp->cmd nor clear lrbp->cmd in error paths.\n\n - In ufshcd_release_scsi_cmd(), do not clear lrbp->cmd.\n\nSee also scsi_send_eh_cmnd().\n\nThis commit prevents that the following appears if a command times out:\n\nWARNING: at drivers/ufs/core/ufshcd.c:2965 ufshcd_queuecommand+0x6f8/0x9a8\nCall trace:\n ufshcd_queuecommand+0x6f8/0x9a8\n scsi_send_eh_cmnd+0x2c0/0x960\n scsi_eh_test_devices+0x100/0x314\n scsi_eh_ready_devs+0xd90/0x114c\n scsi_error_handler+0x2b4/0xb70\n kthread+0x16c/0x1e0",
