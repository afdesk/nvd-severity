  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmacvlan: add forgotten nla_policy for IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF\n\nThe previous commit 954d1fa1ac93 (\"macvlan: Add netlink attribute for\nbroadcast cutoff\") added one additional attribute named\nIFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF to allow broadcast cutfoff.\n\nHowever, it forgot to describe the nla_policy at macvlan_policy\n(drivers/net/macvlan.c). Hence, this suppose NLA_S32 (4 bytes) integer\ncan be faked as empty (0 bytes) by a malicious user, which could leads\nto OOB in heap just like CVE-2023-3773.\n\nTo fix it, this commit just completes the nla_policy description for\nIFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF. This enforces the length check and avoids the\npotential OOB read.",
