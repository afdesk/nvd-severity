  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncpufreq: davinci: Fix clk use after free\n\nThe remove function first frees the clks and only then calls\ncpufreq_unregister_driver(). If one of the cpufreq callbacks is called\njust before cpufreq_unregister_driver() is run, the freed clks might be\nused.",
