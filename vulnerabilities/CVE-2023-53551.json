  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: u_serial: Add null pointer check in gserial_resume\n\nConsider a case where gserial_disconnect has already cleared\ngser->ioport. And if a wakeup interrupt triggers afterwards,\ngserial_resume gets called, which will lead to accessing of\ngser->ioport and thus causing null pointer dereference.Add\na null pointer check to prevent this.\n\nAdded a static spinlock to prevent gser->ioport from becoming\nnull after the newly added check.",
