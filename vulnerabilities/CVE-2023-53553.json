  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: hyperv: avoid struct memcpy overrun warning\n\nA previous patch addressed the fortified memcpy warning for most\nbuilds, but I still see this one with gcc-9:\n\nIn file included from include/linux/string.h:254,\n                 from drivers/hid/hid-hyperv.c:8:\nIn function 'fortify_memcpy_chk',\n    inlined from 'mousevsc_on_receive' at drivers/hid/hid-hyperv.c:272:3:\ninclude/linux/fortify-string.h:583:4: error: call to '__write_overflow_field' declared with attribute warning: detected write beyond size of field (1st parameter); maybe use struct_group()? [-Werror=attribute-warning]\n  583 |    __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size);\n      |    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy guess is that the WARN_ON() itself is what confuses gcc, so it no\nlonger sees that there is a correct range check. Rework the code in a\nway that helps readability and avoids the warning.",
