  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/core: initialize damo_filter->list from damos_new_filter()\n\ndamos_new_filter() is not initializing the list field of newly allocated\nfilter object.  However, DAMON sysfs interface and DAMON_RECLAIM are not\ninitializing it after calling damos_new_filter().  As a result, accessing\nuninitialized memory is possible.  Actually, adding multiple DAMOS filters\nvia DAMON sysfs interface caused NULL pointer dereferencing.  Initialize\nthe field just after the allocation from damos_new_filter().",
