  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nip_vti: fix potential slab-use-after-free in decode_session6\n\nWhen ip_vti device is set to the qdisc of the sfb type, the cb field\nof the sent skb may be modified during enqueuing. Then,\nslab-use-after-free may occur when ip_vti device sends IPv6 packets.\nAs commit f855691975bb (\"xfrm6: Fix the nexthdr offset in\n_decode_session6.\") showed, xfrm_decode_session was originally intended\nonly for the receive path. IP6CB(skb)->nhoff is not set during\ntransmission. Therefore, set the cb field in the skb to 0 before\nsending packets.",
