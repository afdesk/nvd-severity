  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: wwan: iosm: fix NULL pointer dereference when removing device\n\nIn suspend and resume cycle, the removal and rescan of device ends\nup in NULL pointer dereference.\n\nDuring driver initialization, if the ipc_imem_wwan_channel_init()\nfails to get the valid device capabilities it returns an error and\nfurther no resource (wwan struct) will be allocated. Now in this\nsituation if driver removal procedure is initiated it would result\nin NULL pointer exception since unallocated wwan struct is dereferenced\ninside ipc_wwan_deinit().\n\nipc_imem_run_state_worker() to handle the called functions return value\nand to release the resource in failure case. It also reports the link\ndown event in failure cases. The user space application can handle this\nevent to do a device reset for restoring the device communication.",
