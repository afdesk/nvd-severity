  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: Check for probe() id argument being NULL\n\nThe probe() id argument may be NULL in 2 scenarios:\n\n1. brcmf_pcie_pm_leave_D3() calling brcmf_pcie_probe() to reprobe\n   the device.\n\n2. If a user tries to manually bind the driver from sysfs then the sdio /\n   pcie / usb probe() function gets called with NULL as id argument.\n\n1. Is being hit by users causing the following oops on resume and causing\nwifi to stop working:\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n<snip>\nHardware name: Dell Inc. XPS 13 9350/0PWNCR, BIDS 1.13.0 02/10/2020\nWorkgueue: events_unbound async_run_entry_fn\nRIP: 0010:brcmf_pcie_probe+Ox16b/0x7a0 [brcmfmac]\n<snip>\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n brcmf_pcie_pm_leave_D3+0xc5/8x1a0 [brcmfmac be3b4cefca451e190fa35be8f00db1bbec293887]\n ? pci_pm_resume+0x5b/0xf0\n ? pci_legacy_resume+0x80/0x80\n dpm_run_callback+0x47/0x150\n device_resume+0xa2/0x1f0\n async_resume+0x1d/0x30\n<snip>\n\nFix this by checking for id being NULL.\n\nIn the PCI and USB cases try a manual lookup of the id so that manually\nbinding the driver through sysfs and more importantly brcmf_pcie_probe()\non resume will work.\n\nFor the SDIO case there is no helper to do a manual sdio_device_id lookup,\nso just directly error out on a NULL id there.",
