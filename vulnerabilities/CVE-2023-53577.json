  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, cpumap: Make sure kthread is running before map update returns\n\nThe following warning was reported when running stress-mode enabled\nxdp_redirect_cpu with some RT threads:\n\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 65 at kernel/bpf/cpumap.c:135\n  CPU: 4 PID: 65 Comm: kworker/4:1 Not tainted 6.5.0-rc2+ #1\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)\n  Workqueue: events cpu_map_kthread_stop\n  RIP: 0010:put_cpu_map_entry+0xda/0x220\n  ......\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ? show_regs+0x65/0x70\n   ? __warn+0xa5/0x240\n   ......\n   ? put_cpu_map_entry+0xda/0x220\n   cpu_map_kthread_stop+0x41/0x60\n   process_one_work+0x6b0/0xb80\n   worker_thread+0x96/0x720\n   kthread+0x1a5/0x1f0\n   ret_from_fork+0x3a/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n   </TASK>\n\nThe root cause is the same as commit 436901649731 (\"bpf: cpumap: Fix memory\nleak in cpu_map_update_elem\"). The kthread is stopped prematurely by\nkthread_stop() in cpu_map_kthread_stop(), and kthread() doesn't call\ncpu_map_kthread_run() at all but XDP program has already queued some\nframes or skbs into ptr_ring. So when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() checks\nthe ptr_ring, it will find it was not emptied and report a warning.\n\nAn alternative fix is to use __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() to drop these\npending frames or skbs when kthread_stop() returns -EINTR, but it may\nconfuse the user, because these frames or skbs have been handled\ncorrectly by XDP program. So instead of dropping these frames or skbs,\njust make sure the per-cpu kthread is running before\n__cpu_map_entry_alloc() returns.\n\nAfter apply the fix, the error handle for kthread_stop() will be\nunnecessary because it will always return 0, so just remove it.",
