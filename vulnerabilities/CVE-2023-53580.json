  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: Gadget: core: Help prevent panic during UVC unconfigure\n\nAvichal Rakesh reported a kernel panic that occurred when the UVC\ngadget driver was removed from a gadget's configuration.  The panic\ninvolves a somewhat complicated interaction between the kernel driver\nand a userspace component (as described in the Link tag below), but\nthe analysis did make one thing clear: The Gadget core should\naccomodate gadget drivers calling usb_gadget_deactivate() as part of\ntheir unbind procedure.\n\nCurrently this doesn't work.  gadget_unbind_driver() calls\ndriver->unbind() while holding the udc->connect_lock mutex, and\nusb_gadget_deactivate() attempts to acquire that mutex, which will\nresult in a deadlock.\n\nThe simple fix is for gadget_unbind_driver() to release the mutex when\ninvoking the ->unbind() callback.  There is no particular reason for\nit to be holding the mutex at that time, and the mutex isn't held\nwhile the ->bind() callback is invoked.  So we'll drop the mutex\nbefore performing the unbind callback and reacquire it afterward.\n\nWe'll also add a couple of comments to usb_gadget_activate() and\nusb_gadget_deactivate().  Because they run in process context they\nmust not be called from a gadget driver's ->disconnect() callback,\nwhich (according to the kerneldoc for struct usb_gadget_driver in\ninclude/linux/usb/gadget.h) may run in interrupt context.  This may\nhelp prevent similar bugs from arising in the future.",
