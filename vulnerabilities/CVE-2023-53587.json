  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nring-buffer: Sync IRQ works before buffer destruction\n\nIf something was written to the buffer just before destruction,\nit may be possible (maybe not in a real system, but it did\nhappen in ARCH=um with time-travel) to destroy the ringbuffer\nbefore the IRQ work ran, leading this KASAN report (or a crash\nwithout KASAN):\n\n    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in irq_work_run_list+0x11a/0x13a\n    Read of size 8 at addr 000000006d640a48 by task swapper/0\n\n    CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Tainted: G        W  O       6.3.0-rc1 #7\n    Stack:\n     60c4f20f 0c203d48 41b58ab3 60f224fc\n     600477fa 60f35687 60c4f20f 601273dd\n     00000008 6101eb00 6101eab0 615be548\n    Call Trace:\n     [<60047a58>] show_stack+0x25e/0x282\n     [<60c609e0>] dump_stack_lvl+0x96/0xfd\n     [<60c50d4c>] print_report+0x1a7/0x5a8\n     [<603078d3>] kasan_report+0xc1/0xe9\n     [<60308950>] __asan_report_load8_noabort+0x1b/0x1d\n     [<60232844>] irq_work_run_list+0x11a/0x13a\n     [<602328b4>] irq_work_tick+0x24/0x34\n     [<6017f9dc>] update_process_times+0x162/0x196\n     [<6019f335>] tick_sched_handle+0x1a4/0x1c3\n     [<6019fd9e>] tick_sched_timer+0x79/0x10c\n     [<601812b9>] __hrtimer_run_queues.constprop.0+0x425/0x695\n     [<60182913>] hrtimer_interrupt+0x16c/0x2c4\n     [<600486a3>] um_timer+0x164/0x183\n     [...]\n\n    Allocated by task 411:\n     save_stack_trace+0x99/0xb5\n     stack_trace_save+0x81/0x9b\n     kasan_save_stack+0x2d/0x54\n     kasan_set_track+0x34/0x3e\n     kasan_save_alloc_info+0x25/0x28\n     ____kasan_kmalloc+0x8b/0x97\n     __kasan_kmalloc+0x10/0x12\n     __kmalloc+0xb2/0xe8\n     load_elf_phdrs+0xee/0x182\n     [...]\n\n    The buggy address belongs to the object at 000000006d640800\n     which belongs to the cache kmalloc-1k of size 1024\n    The buggy address is located 584 bytes inside of\n     freed 1024-byte region [000000006d640800, 000000006d640c00)\n\nAdd the appropriate irq_work_sync() so the work finishes before\nthe buffers are destroyed.\n\nPrior to the commit in the Fixes tag below, there was only a\nsingle global IRQ work, so this issue didn't exist.",
