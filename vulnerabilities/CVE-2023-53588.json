  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: check for station first in client probe\n\nWhen probing a client, first check if we have it, and then\ncheck for the channel context, otherwise you can trigger\nthe warning there easily by probing when the AP isn't even\nstarted yet. Since a client existing means the AP is also\noperating, we can then keep the warning.\n\nAlso simplify the moved code a bit.",
