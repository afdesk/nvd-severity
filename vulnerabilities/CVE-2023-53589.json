  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't trust firmware n_channels\n\nIf the firmware sends us a corrupted MCC response with\nn_channels much larger than the command response can be,\nwe might copy far too much (uninitialized) memory and\neven crash if the n_channels is large enough to make it\nrun out of the one page allocated for the FW response.\n\nFix that by checking the lengths. Doing a < comparison\nwould be sufficient, but the firmware should be doing\nit correctly, so check more strictly.",
