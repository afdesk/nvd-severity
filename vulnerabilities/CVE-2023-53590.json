  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: add a refcnt in sctp_stream_priorities to avoid a nested loop\n\nWith this refcnt added in sctp_stream_priorities, we don't need to\ntraverse all streams to check if the prio is used by other streams\nwhen freeing one stream's prio in sctp_sched_prio_free_sid(). This\ncan avoid a nested loop (up to 65535 * 65535), which may cause a\nstuck as Ying reported:\n\n    watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#23 stuck for 26s!
