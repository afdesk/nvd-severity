  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: fix mid leak during reconnection after timeout threshold\n\nWhen the number of responses with status of STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT\nexceeds a specified threshold (NUM_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT), we reconnect\nthe connection. But we do not return the mid, or the credits\nreturned for the mid, or reduce the number of in-flight requests.\n\nThis bug could result in the server->in_flight count to go bad,\nand also cause a leak in the mids.\n\nThis change moves the check to a few lines below where the\nresponse is decrypted, even of the response is read from the\ntransform header. This way, the code for returning the mids\ncan be reused.\n\nAlso, the cifs_reconnect was reconnecting just the transport\nconnection before. In case of multi-channel, this may not be\nwhat we want to do after several timeouts. Changed that to\nreconnect the session and the tree too.\n\nAlso renamed NUM_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT to a more appropriate name\nMAX_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT.",
