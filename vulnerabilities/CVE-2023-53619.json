  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: conntrack: Avoid nf_ct_helper_hash uses after free\n\nIf nf_conntrack_init_start() fails (for example due to a\nregister_nf_conntrack_bpf() failure), the nf_conntrack_helper_fini()\nclean-up path frees the nf_ct_helper_hash map.\n\nWhen built with NF_CONNTRACK=y, further netfilter modules (e.g:\nnetfilter_conntrack_ftp) can still be loaded and call\nnf_conntrack_helpers_register(), independently of whether nf_conntrack\ninitialized correctly. This accesses the nf_ct_helper_hash dangling\npointer and causes a uaf, possibly leading to random memory corruption.\n\nThis patch guards nf_conntrack_helper_register() from accessing a freed\nor uninitialized nf_ct_helper_hash pointer and fixes possible\nuses-after-free when loading a conntrack module.",
