  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: fix soft lockup in status_resync\n\nstatus_resync() will calculate 'curr_resync - recovery_active' to show\nuser a progress bar like following:\n\n[============>........]  resync = 61.4%\n\n'curr_resync' and 'recovery_active' is updated in md_do_sync(), and\nstatus_resync() can read them concurrently, hence it's possible that\n'curr_resync - recovery_active' can overflow to a huge number. In this\ncase status_resync() will be stuck in the loop to print a large amount\nof '=', which will end up soft lockup.\n\nFix the problem by setting 'resync' to MD_RESYNC_ACTIVE in this case,\nthis way resync in progress will be reported to user.",
