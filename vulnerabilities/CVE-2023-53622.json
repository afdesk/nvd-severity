  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Fix possible data races in gfs2_show_options()\n\nSome fields such as gt_logd_secs of the struct gfs2_tune are accessed\nwithout holding the lock gt_spin in gfs2_show_options():\n\n  val = sdp->sd_tune.gt_logd_secs;\n  if (val != 30)\n    seq_printf(s, \",commit=%d\", val);\n\nAnd thus can cause data races when gfs2_show_options() and other functions\nsuch as gfs2_reconfigure() are concurrently executed:\n\n  spin_lock(&gt->gt_spin);\n  gt->gt_logd_secs = newargs->ar_commit;\n\nTo fix these possible data races, the lock sdp->sd_tune.gt_spin is\nacquired before accessing the fields of gfs2_tune and released after these\naccesses.\n\nFurther changes by Andreas:\n\n- Don't hold the spin lock over the seq_printf operations.",
