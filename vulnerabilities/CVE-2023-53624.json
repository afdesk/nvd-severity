  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_fq: fix integer overflow of \"credit\"\n\nif sch_fq is configured with \"initial quantum\" having values greater than\nINT_MAX, the first assignment of \"credit\" does signed integer overflow to\na very negative value.\nIn this situation, the syzkaller script provided by Cristoph triggers the\nCPU soft-lockup warning even with few sockets. It's not an infinite loop,\nbut \"credit\" wasn't probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow.\nCapping \"initial quantum\" to INT_MAX proved to fix the issue.\n\nv2: validation of \"initial quantum\" is done in fq_policy, instead of open\n    coding in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski",
