  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteon_ep: cancel queued works in probe error path\n\nIf it fails to get the devices's MAC address, octep_probe exits while\nleaving the delayed work intr_poll_task queued. When the work later\nruns, it's a use after free.\n\nMove the cancelation of intr_poll_task from octep_remove into\noctep_device_cleanup. This does not change anything in the octep_remove\nflow, but octep_device_cleanup is called also in the octep_probe error\npath, where the cancelation is needed.\n\nNote that the cancelation of ctrl_mbox_task has to follow\nintr_poll_task's, because the ctrl_mbox_task may be queued by\nintr_poll_task.",
