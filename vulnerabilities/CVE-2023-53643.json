  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-tcp: don't access released socket during error recovery\n\nWhile the error recovery work is temporarily failing reconnect attempts,\nrunning the 'nvme list' command causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference\nby calling getsockname() with a released socket.\n\nDuring error recovery work, the nvme tcp socket is released and a new one\ncreated, so it is not safe to access the socket without proper check.",
