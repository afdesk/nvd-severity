  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: bcm-qspi: return error if neither hif_mspi nor mspi is available\n\nIf neither a \"hif_mspi\" nor \"mspi\" resource is present, the driver will\njust early exit in probe but still return success. Apart from not doing\nanything meaningful, this would then also lead to a null pointer access\non removal, as platform_get_drvdata() would return NULL, which it would\nthen try to dereference when trying to unregister the spi master.\n\nFix this by unconditionally calling devm_ioremap_resource(), as it can\nhandle a NULL res and will then return a viable ERR_PTR() if we get one.\n\nThe \"return 0;\" was previously a \"goto qspi_resource_err;\" where then\nret was returned, but since ret was still initialized to 0 at this place\nthis was a valid conversion in 63c5395bb7a9 (\"spi: bcm-qspi: Fix\nuse-after-free on unbind\"). The issue was not introduced by this commit,\nonly made more obvious.",
