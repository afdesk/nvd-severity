  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, cpumap: Handle skb as well when clean up ptr_ring\n\nThe following warning was reported when running xdp_redirect_cpu with\nboth skb-mode and stress-mode enabled:\n\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  Incorrect XDP memory type (-2128176192) usage\n  WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1442 at net/core/xdp.c:405\n  Modules linked in:\n  CPU: 7 PID: 1442 Comm: kworker/7:0 Tainted: G  6.5.0-rc2+ #1\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)\n  Workqueue: events __cpu_map_entry_free\n  RIP: 0010:__xdp_return+0x1e4/0x4a0\n  ......\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ? show_regs+0x65/0x70\n   ? __warn+0xa5/0x240\n   ? __xdp_return+0x1e4/0x4a0\n   ......\n   xdp_return_frame+0x4d/0x150\n   __cpu_map_entry_free+0xf9/0x230\n   process_one_work+0x6b0/0xb80\n   worker_thread+0x96/0x720\n   kthread+0x1a5/0x1f0\n   ret_from_fork+0x3a/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n   </TASK>\n\nThe reason for the warning is twofold. One is due to the kthread\ncpu_map_kthread_run() is stopped prematurely. Another one is\n__cpu_map_ring_cleanup() doesn't handle skb mode and treats skbs in\nptr_ring as XDP frames.\n\nPrematurely-stopped kthread will be fixed by the preceding patch and\nptr_ring will be empty when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() is called. But\nas the comments in __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() said, handling and freeing\nskbs in ptr_ring as well to \"catch any broken behaviour gracefully\".",
