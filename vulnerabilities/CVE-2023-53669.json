  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: fix skb_copy_ubufs() vs BIG TCP\n\nDavid Ahern reported crashes in skb_copy_ubufs() caused by TCP tx zerocopy\nusing hugepages, and skb length bigger than ~68 KB.\n\nskb_copy_ubufs() assumed it could copy all payload using up to\nMAX_SKB_FRAGS order-0 pages.\n\nThis assumption broke when BIG TCP was able to put up to 512 KB per skb.\n\nWe did not hit this bug at Google because we use CONFIG_MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45\nand limit gso_max_size to 180000.\n\nA solution is to use higher order pages if needed.\n\nv2: add missing __GFP_COMP, or we leak memory.",
