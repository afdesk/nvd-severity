  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: output extra debug info if we failed to find an inline backref\n\n[BUG]\nSyzbot reported several warning triggered inside\nlookup_inline_extent_backref().\n\n[CAUSE]\nAs usual, the reproducer doesn't reliably trigger locally here, but at\nleast we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline backref can not\nbe found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e.\ninserting a new inline backref, which means the backref should already\nexist)\n\n[ENHANCEMENT]\nAfter the WARN_ON(), dump all the parameters and the extent tree\nleaf to help debug.",
