  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: iscsi: Fix buffer overflow in lio_target_nacl_info_show()\n\nThe function lio_target_nacl_info_show() uses sprintf() in a loop to print\ndetails for every iSCSI connection in a session without checking for the\nbuffer length. With enough iSCSI connections it's possible to overflow the\nbuffer provided by configfs and corrupt the memory.\n\nThis patch replaces sprintf() with sysfs_emit_at() that checks for buffer\nboundries.",
