  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSD: Avoid calling OPDESC() with ops->opnum == OP_ILLEGAL\n\nOPDESC() simply indexes into nfsd4_ops[] by the op's operation\nnumber, without range checking that value. It assumes callers are\ncareful to avoid calling it with an out-of-bounds opnum value.\n\nnfsd4_decode_compound() is not so careful, and can invoke OPDESC()\nwith opnum set to OP_ILLEGAL, which is 10044 -- well beyond the end\nof nfsd4_ops[].",
