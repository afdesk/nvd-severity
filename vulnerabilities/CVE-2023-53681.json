  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbcache: Fix __bch_btree_node_alloc to make the failure behavior consistent\n\nIn some specific situations, the return value of __bch_btree_node_alloc\nmay be NULL. This may lead to a potential NULL pointer dereference in\ncaller function like a calling chain :\nbtree_split->bch_btree_node_alloc->__bch_btree_node_alloc.\n\nFix it by initializing the return value in __bch_btree_node_alloc.",
