  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: Zero padding when dumping algos and encap\n\nWhen copying data to user-space we should ensure that only valid\ndata is copied over.  Padding in structures may be filled with\nrandom (possibly sensitve) data and should never be given directly\nto user-space.\n\nThis patch fixes the copying of xfrm algorithms and the encap\ntemplate in xfrm_user so that padding is zeroed.",
