  "Description": "Nagios Fusion versions prior to\u00a04.2.0 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the license key configuration flow that can result in execution of attacker-controlled script in the browser of a user who follows a crafted URL. While the application server itself is not directly corrupted by the reflected XSS, the resulting browser compromise can lead to credential/session theft and unauthorized administrative actions.",
