  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: imx: clk-imx8mp: improve error handling in imx8mp_clocks_probe()\n\nReplace of_iomap() and kzalloc() with devm_of_iomap() and devm_kzalloc()\nwhich can automatically release the related memory when the device\nor driver is removed or unloaded to avoid potential memory leak.\n\nIn this case, iounmap(anatop_base) in line 427,433 are removed\nas manual release is not required.\n\nBesides, referring to clk-imx8mq.c, check the return code of\nof_clk_add_hw_provider, if it returns negtive, print error info\nand unregister hws, which makes the program more robust.",
