  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: sme: Use STR P to clear FFR context field in streaming SVE mode\n\nThe FFR is a predicate register which can vary between 16 and 256 bits\nin size depending upon the configured vector length. When saving the\nSVE state in streaming SVE mode, the FFR register is inaccessible and\nso commit 9f5848665788 (\"arm64/sve: Make access to FFR optional\") simply\nclears the FFR field of the in-memory context structure. Unfortunately,\nit achieves this using an unconditional 8-byte store and so if the SME\nvector length is anything other than 64 bytes in size we will either\nfail to clear the entire field or, worse, we will corrupt memory\nimmediately following the structure. This has led to intermittent kfence\nsplats in CI [1] and can trigger kmalloc Redzone corruption messages\nwhen running the 'fp-stress' kselftest:\n\n | =============================================================================\n | BUG kmalloc-1k (Not tainted): kmalloc Redzone overwritten\n | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n |\n | 0xffff000809bf1e22-0xffff000809bf1e27 @offset=7714.
