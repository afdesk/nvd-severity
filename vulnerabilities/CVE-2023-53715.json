  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Pass the PMK in binary instead of hex\n\nApparently the hex passphrase mechanism does not work on newer\nchips/firmware (e.g. BCM4387). It seems there was a simple way of\npassing it in binary all along, so use that and avoid the hexification.\n\nOpenBSD has been doing it like this from the beginning, so this should\nwork on all chips.\n\nAlso clear the structure before setting the PMK. This was leaking\nuninitialized stack contents to the device.",
