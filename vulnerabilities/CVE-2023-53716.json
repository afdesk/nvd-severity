  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix skb leak in __skb_tstamp_tx()\n\nCommit 50749f2dd685 (\"tcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy skbs with\nTX timestamp.\") added a call to skb_orphan_frags_rx() to fix leaks with\nzerocopy skbs. But it ended up adding a leak of its own. When\nskb_orphan_frags_rx() fails, the function just returns, leaking the skb\nit just cloned. Free it before returning.\n\nThis bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis\nSecurity Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.",
