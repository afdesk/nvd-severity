  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndccp: Fix out of bounds access in DCCP error handler\n\nThere was a previous attempt to fix an out-of-bounds access in the DCCP\nerror handlers, but that fix assumed that the error handlers only want\nto access the first 8 bytes of the DCCP header. Actually, they also look\nat the DCCP sequence number, which is stored beyond 8 bytes, so an\nexplicit pskb_may_pull() is required.",
