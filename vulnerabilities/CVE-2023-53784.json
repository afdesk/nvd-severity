  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm: bridge: dw_hdmi: fix connector access for scdc\n\nCommit 5d844091f237 (\"drm/scdc-helper: Pimp SCDC debugs\") changed the scdc\ninterface to pick up an i2c adapter from a connector instead. However, in\nthe case of dw-hdmi, the wrong connector was being used to pass i2c adapter\ninformation, since dw-hdmi's embedded connector structure is only populated\nwhen the bridge attachment callback explicitly asks for it.\n\ndrm-meson is handling connector creation, so this won't happen, leading to\na NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFix it by having scdc functions access dw-hdmi's current connector pointer\ninstead, which is assigned during the bridge enablement stage.\n\n[narmstrong: moved Fixes tag before first S-o-b and added Reported-by tag]",
