  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath9k: htc_hst: free skb in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() if there is no callback function\n\nIt is stated that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees the provided skb or\npasses its management to another callback function. However, the skb is\nnot freed in case there is no another callback function, and Syzkaller was\nable to cause a memory leak. Also minor comment fix.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
