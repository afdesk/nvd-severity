  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in nilfs_evict_inode()\n\nDuring unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after\nnilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  However, since\nnilfs_evict_inode() uses nilfs_root for some cleanup operations, it may\ncause use-after-free read if inodes are left in \"garbage_list\" and\nreleased by nilfs_dispose_list() at the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer().\n\nFix this issue by modifying nilfs_evict_inode() to only clear inode\nwithout additional metadata changes that use nilfs_root if the file system\nis degraded to read-only or the writer is detached.",
