  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nposix-timers: Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()\n\nitimer_delete() has a retry loop when the timer is concurrently expired. On\nnon-RT kernels this just spin-waits until the timer callback has completed,\nexcept for posix CPU timers which have HAVE_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK\nenabled.\n\nIn that case and on RT kernels the existing task could live lock when\npreempting the task which does the timer delivery.\n\nReplace spin_unlock() with an invocation of timer_wait_running() to handle\nit the same way as the other retry loops in the posix timer code.",
