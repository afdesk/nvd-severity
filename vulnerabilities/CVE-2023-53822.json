  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath11k: Ignore frags from uninitialized peer in dp.\n\nWhen max virtual ap interfaces are configured in all the bands with\nACS and hostapd restart is done every 60s, a crash is observed at\nrandom times.\nIn this certain scenario, a fragmented packet is received for\nself peer, for which rx_tid and rx_frags are not initialized in\ndatapath. While handling this fragment, crash is observed as the\nrx_frag list is uninitialised and when we walk in\nath11k_dp_rx_h_sort_frags, skb null leads to exception.\n\nTo address this, before processing received fragments we check\ndp_setup_done flag is set to ensure that peer has completed its\ndp peer setup for fragment queue, else ignore processing the\nfragments.\n\nCall trace:\n  ath11k_dp_process_rx_err+0x550/0x1084 [ath11k]\n  ath11k_dp_service_srng+0x70/0x370 [ath11k]\n  0xffffffc009693a04\n  __napi_poll+0x30/0xa4\n  net_rx_action+0x118/0x270\n  __do_softirq+0x10c/0x244\n  irq_exit+0x64/0xb4\n  __handle_domain_irq+0x88/0xac\n  gic_handle_irq+0x74/0xbc\n  el1_irq+0xf0/0x1c0\n  arch_cpu_idle+0x10/0x18\n  do_idle+0x104/0x248\n  cpu_startup_entry+0x20/0x64\n  rest_init+0xd0/0xdc\n  arch_call_rest_init+0xc/0x14\n  start_kernel+0x480/0x4b8\n  Code: f9400281 f94066a2 91405021 b94a0023 (f9406401)\n\nTested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01744-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
