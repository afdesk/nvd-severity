  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state\n\nintel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't\nobtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must check it\nfor NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee\nthat intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.\nWe are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was\nconfirmed to help.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 1d5b09f8daf859247a1ea65b0d732a24d88980d8)",
