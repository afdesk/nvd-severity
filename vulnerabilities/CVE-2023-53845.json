  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix infinite loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()\n\nIf the disk image that nilfs2 mounts is corrupted and a virtual block\naddress obtained by block lookup for a metadata file is invalid,\nnilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() may return the same internal return code as\n-ENOENT, meaning the block does not exist in the metadata file.\n\nThis duplication of return codes confuses nilfs_mdt_get_block(), causing\nit to read and create a metadata block indefinitely.\n\nIn particular, if this happens to the inode metadata file, ifile,\nsemaphore i_rwsem can be left held, causing task hangs in lock_mount.\n\nFix this issue by making nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() treat virtual block\naddress translation failures with -ENOENT as metadata corruption instead\nof returning the error code.",
