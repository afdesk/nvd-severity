  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm: fix workqueue leak on bind errors\n\nMake sure to destroy the workqueue also in case of early errors during\nbind (e.g. a subcomponent failing to bind).\n\nSince commit c3b790ea07a1 (\"drm: Manage drm_mode_config_init with\ndrmm_\") the mode config will be freed when the drm device is released\nalso when using the legacy interface, but add an explicit cleanup for\nconsistency and to facilitate backporting.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/525093/",
