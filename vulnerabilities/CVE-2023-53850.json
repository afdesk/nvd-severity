  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niavf: use internal state to free traffic IRQs\n\nIf the system tries to close the netdev while iavf_reset_task() is\nrunning, __LINK_STATE_START will be cleared and netif_running() will\nreturn false in iavf_reinit_interrupt_scheme(). This will result in\niavf_free_traffic_irqs() not being called and a leak as follows:\n\n    [7632.489326] remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/999', leaking at least 'iavf-enp24s0f0v0-TxRx-0'\n    [7632.490214] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10 at fs/proc/generic.c:718 remove_proc_entry+0x19b/0x1b0\n\nis shown when pci_disable_msix() is later called. Fix by using the\ninternal adapter state. The traffic IRQs will always exist if\nstate == __IAVF_RUNNING.",
