  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nof: overlay: Call of_changeset_init() early\n\nWhen of_overlay_fdt_apply() fails, the changeset may be partially\napplied, and the caller is still expected to call of_overlay_remove() to\nclean up this partial state.\n\nHowever, of_overlay_apply() calls of_resolve_phandles() before\ninit_overlay_changeset().  Hence if the overlay fails to apply due to an\nunresolved symbol, the overlay_changeset.cset.entries list is still\nuninitialized, and cleanup will crash with a NULL-pointer dereference in\noverlay_removal_is_ok().\n\nFix this by moving the call to of_changeset_init() from\ninit_overlay_changeset() to of_overlay_fdt_apply(), where all other\nearly initialization is done.",
