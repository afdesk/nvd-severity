  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nping: Fix potentail NULL deref for /proc/net/icmp.\n\nAfter commit dbca1596bbb0 (\"ping: convert to RCU lookups, get rid\nof rwlock\"), we use RCU for ping sockets, but we should use spinlock\nfor /proc/net/icmp to avoid a potential NULL deref mentioned in\nthe previous patch.\n\nLet's go back to using spinlock there.\n\nNote we can convert ping sockets to use hlist instead of hlist_nulls\nbecause we do not use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU for ping sockets.",
