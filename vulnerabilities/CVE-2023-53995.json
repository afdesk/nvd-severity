  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ipv4: fix one memleak in __inet_del_ifa()\n\nI got the below warning when do fuzzing test:\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for bond0 to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nIt can be repoduced via:\n\nip link add bond0 type bond\nsysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.bond0.promote_secondaries=1\nip addr add 4.117.174.103/0 scope 0x40 dev bond0\nip addr add 192.168.100.111/255.255.255.254 scope 0 dev bond0\nip addr add 0.0.0.4/0 scope 0x40 secondary dev bond0\nip addr del 4.117.174.103/0 scope 0x40 dev bond0\nip link delete bond0 type bond\n\nIn this reproduction test case, an incorrect 'last_prim' is found in\n__inet_del_ifa(), as a result, the secondary address(0.0.0.4/0 scope 0x40)\nis lost. The memory of the secondary address is leaked and the reference of\nin_device and net_device is leaked.\n\nFix this problem:\nLook for 'last_prim' starting at location of the deleted IP and inserting\nthe promoted IP into the location of 'last_prim'.",
