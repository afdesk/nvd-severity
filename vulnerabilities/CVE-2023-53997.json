  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal: of: fix double-free on unregistration\n\nSince commit 3d439b1a2ad3 (\"thermal/core: Alloc-copy-free the thermal\nzone parameters structure\"), thermal_zone_device_register() allocates\na copy of the tzp argument and frees it when unregistering, so\nthermal_of_zone_register() now ends up leaking its original tzp and\ndouble-freeing the tzp copy. Fix this by locating tzp on stack instead.",
