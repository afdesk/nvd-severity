  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: cadence: cdns_i2c_master_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path\n\nThe cdns_i2c_master_xfer() function gets a runtime PM reference when the\nfunction is entered. This reference is released when the function is\nexited. There is currently one error path where the function exits\ndirectly, which leads to a leak of the runtime PM reference.\n\nMake sure that this error path also releases the runtime PM reference.",
