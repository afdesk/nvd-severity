  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix stack overflow when LRO is disabled for virtual interfaces\n\nWhen the virtual interface's feature is updated, it synchronizes the\nupdated feature for its own lower interface.\nThis propagation logic should be worked as the iteration, not recursively.\nBut it works recursively due to the netdev notification unexpectedly.\nThis problem occurs when it disables LRO only for the team and bonding\ninterface type.\n\n       team0\n         |\n  +------+------+-----+-----+\n  |      |      |     |     |\nteam1  team2  team3  ...  team200\n\nIf team0's LRO feature is updated, it generates the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE\nevent to its own lower interfaces(team1 ~ team200).\nIt is worked by netdev_sync_lower_features().\nSo, the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE notification logic of each lower interface\nwork iteratively.\nBut generated NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event is also sent to the upper\ninterface too.\nupper interface(team0) generates the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event for its own\nlower interfaces again.\nlower and upper interfaces receive this event and generate this\nevent again and again.\nSo, the stack overflow occurs.\n\nBut it is not the infinite loop issue.\nBecause the netdev_sync_lower_features() updates features before\ngenerating the NETDEV_FEAT_CHANGE event.\nAlready synchronized lower interfaces skip notification logic.\nSo, it is just the problem that iteration logic is changed to the\nrecursive unexpectedly due to the notification mechanism.\n\nReproducer:\n\nip link add team0 type team\nethtool -K team0 lro on\nfor i in {1..200}\ndo\n        ip link add team$i master team0 type team\n        ethtool -K team$i lro on\ndone\n\nethtool -K team0 lro off\n\nIn order to fix it, the notifier_ctx member of bonding/team is introduced.",
