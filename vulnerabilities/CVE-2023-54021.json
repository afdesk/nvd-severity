  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: set goal start correctly in ext4_mb_normalize_request\n\nWe need to set ac_g_ex to notify the goal start used in\next4_mb_find_by_goal. Set ac_g_ex instead of ac_f_ex in\next4_mb_normalize_request.\nBesides we should assure goal start is in range [first_data_block,\nblocks_count) as ext4_mb_initialize_context does.\n\n[ Added a check to make sure size is less than ar->pright; otherwise\n  we could end up passing an underflowed value of ar->pright - size to\n  ext4_get_group_no_and_offset(), which will trigger a BUG_ON later on.\n  - TYT ]",
