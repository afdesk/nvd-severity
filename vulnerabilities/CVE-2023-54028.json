  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/rxe: Fix the error \"trying to register non-static key in rxe_cleanup_task\"\n\nIn the function rxe_create_qp(), rxe_qp_from_init() is called to\ninitialize qp, internally things like rxe_init_task are not setup until\nrxe_qp_init_req().\n\nIf an error occurred before this point then the unwind will call\nrxe_cleanup() and eventually to rxe_qp_do_cleanup()/rxe_cleanup_task()\nwhich will oops when trying to access the uninitialized spinlock.\n\nIf rxe_init_task is not executed, rxe_cleanup_task will not be called.",
