  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: fix underflow in chain reference counter\n\nSet element addition error path decrements reference counter on chains\ntwice: once on element release and again via nft_data_release().\n\nThen, d6b478666ffa (\"netfilter: nf_tables: fix underflow in object\nreference counter\") incorrectly fixed this by removing the stateful\nobject reference count decrement.\n\nRestore the stateful object decrement as in b91d90368837 (\"netfilter:\nnf_tables: fix leaking object reference count\") and let\nnft_data_release() decrement the chain reference counter, so this is\ndone only once.",
