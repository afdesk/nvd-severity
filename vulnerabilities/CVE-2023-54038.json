  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_conn: return ERR_PTR instead of NULL when there is no link\n\nhci_connect_sco currently returns NULL when there is no link (i.e. when\nhci_conn_link() returns NULL).\n\nsco_connect() expects an ERR_PTR in case of any error (see line 266 in\nsco.c). Thus, hcon set as NULL passes through to sco_conn_add(), which\ntries to get hcon->hdev, resulting in dereferencing a NULL pointer as\nreported by syzkaller.\n\nThe same issue exists for iso_connect_cis() calling hci_connect_cis().\n\nThus, make hci_connect_sco() and hci_connect_cis() return ERR_PTR\ninstead of NULL.",
