  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: j1939: j1939_tp_tx_dat_new(): fix out-of-bounds memory access\n\nIn the j1939_tp_tx_dat_new() function, an out-of-bounds memory access\ncould occur during the memcpy() operation if the size of skb->cb is\nlarger than the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This is because the\nmemcpy() operation uses the size of skb->cb, leading to a read beyond\nthe struct j1939_sk_buff_cb.\n\nUpdated the memcpy() operation to use the size of struct\nj1939_sk_buff_cb instead of the size of skb->cb. This ensures that the\nmemcpy() operation only reads the memory within the bounds of struct\nj1939_sk_buff_cb, preventing out-of-bounds memory access.\n\nAdditionally, add a BUILD_BUG_ON() to check that the size of skb->cb\nis greater than or equal to the size of struct j1939_sk_buff_cb. This\nensures that the skb->cb buffer is large enough to hold the\nj1939_sk_buff_cb structure.\n\n[mkl: rephrase commit message]",
