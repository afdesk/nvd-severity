  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix wrong fallback logic for FDIR\n\nWhen adding a FDIR filter, if ice_vc_fdir_set_irq_ctx returns failure,\nthe inserted fdir entry will not be removed and if ice_vc_fdir_write_fltr\nreturns failure, the fdir context info for irq handler will not be cleared\nwhich may lead to inconsistent or memory leak issue. This patch refines\nfailure cases to resolve this issue.",
