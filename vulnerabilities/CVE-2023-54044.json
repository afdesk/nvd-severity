  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspmi: Add a check for remove callback when removing a SPMI driver\n\nWhen removing a SPMI driver, there can be a crash due to NULL pointer\ndereference if it does not have a remove callback defined. This is\none such call trace observed when removing the QCOM SPMI PMIC driver:\n\n dump_backtrace.cfi_jt+0x0/0x8\n dump_stack_lvl+0xd8/0x16c\n panic+0x188/0x498\n __cfi_slowpath+0x0/0x214\n __cfi_slowpath+0x1dc/0x214\n spmi_drv_remove+0x16c/0x1e0\n device_release_driver_internal+0x468/0x79c\n driver_detach+0x11c/0x1a0\n bus_remove_driver+0xc4/0x124\n driver_unregister+0x58/0x84\n cleanup_module+0x1c/0xc24 [qcom_spmi_pmic]\n __do_sys_delete_module+0x3ec/0x53c\n __arm64_sys_delete_module+0x18/0x28\n el0_svc_common+0xdc/0x294\n el0_svc+0x38/0x9c\n el0_sync_handler+0x8c/0xf0\n el0_sync+0x1b4/0x1c0\n\nIf a driver has all its resources allocated through devm_() APIs and\ndoes not need any other explicit cleanup, it would not require a\nremove callback to be defined. Hence, add a check for remove callback\npresence before calling it when removing a SPMI driver.",
