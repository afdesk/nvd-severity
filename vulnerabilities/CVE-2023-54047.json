  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/rockchip: dw_hdmi: cleanup drm encoder during unbind\n\nThis fixes a use-after-free crash during rmmod.\n\nThe DRM encoder is embedded inside the larger rockchip_hdmi,\nwhich is allocated with the component. The component memory\ngets freed before the main drm device is destroyed. Fix it\nby running encoder cleanup before tearing down its container.\n\n[moved encoder cleanup above clk_disable, similar to bind-error-path]",
