  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nubifs: Fix memleak when insert_old_idx() failed\n\nFollowing process will cause a memleak for copied up znode:\n\ndirty_cow_znode\n  zn = copy_znode(c, znode);\n  err = insert_old_idx(c, zbr->lnum, zbr->offs);\n  if (unlikely(err))\n     return ERR_PTR(err);   // No one refers to zn.\n\nFetch a reproducer in [Link].\n\nFunction copy_znode() is split into 2 parts: resource allocation\nand znode replacement, insert_old_idx() is split in similar way,\nso resource cleanup could be done in error handling path without\ncorrupting metadata(mem & disk).\nIt's okay that old index inserting is put behind of add_idx_dirt(),\nold index is used in layout_leb_in_gaps(), so the two processes do\nnot depend on each other.",
