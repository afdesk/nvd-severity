  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkheaders: Use array declaration instead of char\n\nUnder CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, memcpy() will check the size of destination\nand source buffers. Defining kernel_headers_data as \"char\" would trip\nthis check. Since these addresses are treated as byte arrays, define\nthem as arrays (as done everywhere else).\n\nThis was seen with:\n\n  $ cat /sys/kernel/kheaders.tar.xz >> /dev/null\n\n  detected buffer overflow in memcpy\n  kernel BUG at lib/string_helpers.c:1027!\n  ...\n  RIP: 0010:fortify_panic+0xf/0x20\n  [...]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ikheaders_read+0x45/0x50 [kheaders]\n   kernfs_fop_read_iter+0x1a4/0x2f0\n  ...",
