  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipmi:ssif: Fix a memory leak when scanning for an adapter\n\nThe adapter scan ssif_info_find() sets info->adapter_name if the adapter\ninfo came from SMBIOS, as it's not set in that case.  However, this\nfunction can be called more than once, and it will leak the adapter name\nif it had already been set.  So check for NULL before setting it.",
