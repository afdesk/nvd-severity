  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npower: supply: bq27xxx: Fix poll_interval handling and races on remove\n\nBefore this patch bq27xxx_battery_teardown() was setting poll_interval = 0\nto avoid bq27xxx_battery_update() requeuing the delayed_work item.\n\nThere are 2 problems with this:\n\n1. If the driver is unbound through sysfs, rather then the module being\n   rmmod-ed, this changes poll_interval unexpectedly\n\n2. This is racy, after it being set poll_interval could be changed\n   before bq27xxx_battery_update() checks it through\n   /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval\n\nFix this by added a removed attribute to struct bq27xxx_device_info and\nusing that instead of setting poll_interval to 0.\n\nThere also is another poll_interval related race on remove(), writing\n/sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval will requeue\nthe delayed_work item for all devices on the bq27xxx_battery_devices\nlist and the device being removed was only removed from that list\nafter cancelling the delayed_work item.\n\nFix this by moving the removal from the bq27xxx_battery_devices list\nto before cancelling the delayed_work item.",
