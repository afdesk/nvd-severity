  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nubi: Fix possible null-ptr-deref in ubi_free_volume()\n\nIt willl cause null-ptr-deref in the following case:\n\nuif_init()\n  ubi_add_volume()\n    cdev_add() -> if it fails, call kill_volumes()\n    device_register()\n\nkill_volumes() -> if ubi_add_volume() fails call this function\n  ubi_free_volume()\n    cdev_del()\n    device_unregister() -> trying to delete a not added device,\n\t\t\t   it causes null-ptr-deref\n\nSo in ubi_free_volume(), it delete devices whether they are added\nor not, it will causes null-ptr-deref.\n\nHandle the error case whlie calling ubi_add_volume() to fix this\nproblem. If add volume fails, set the corresponding vol to null,\nso it can not be accessed in kill_volumes() and release the\nresource in ubi_add_volume() error path.",
