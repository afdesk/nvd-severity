  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndriver: soc: xilinx: use _safe loop iterator to avoid a use after free\n\nThe hash_for_each_possible() loop dereferences \"eve_data\" to get the\nnext item on the list.  However the loop frees eve_data so it leads to\na use after free.  Use hash_for_each_possible_safe() instead.",
