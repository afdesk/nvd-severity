  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Prevent lpfc_debugfs_lockstat_write() buffer overflow\n\nA static code analysis tool flagged the possibility of buffer overflow when\nusing copy_from_user() for a debugfs entry.\n\nCurrently, it is possible that copy_from_user() copies more bytes than what\nwould fit in the mybuf char array.  Add a min() restriction check between\nsizeof(mybuf) - 1 and nbytes passed from the userspace buffer to protect\nagainst buffer overflow.",
