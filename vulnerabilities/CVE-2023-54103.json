  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to uncanceled work\n\nIn mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with\nmtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work. Then mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run\nand mtk_jpeg_enc_device_run may be called to start the\nwork.\nIf we remove the module which will call mtk_jpeg_remove\nto make cleanup, there may be a unfinished work. The\npossible sequence is as follows, which will cause a\ntypical UAF bug.\n\nFix it by canceling the work before cleanup in the mtk_jpeg_remove\n\nCPU0                  CPU1\n\n                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work\nmtk_jpeg_remove     |\n  v4l2_m2m_release  |\n    kfree(m2m_dev); |\n                    |\n                    | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv\n                    |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use",
