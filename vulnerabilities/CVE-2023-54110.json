  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: rndis_host: Secure rndis_query check against int overflow\n\nVariables off and len typed as uint32 in rndis_query function\nare controlled by incoming RNDIS response message thus their\nvalue may be manipulated. Setting off to a unexpectetly large\nvalue will cause the sum with len and 8 to overflow and pass\nthe implemented validation step. Consequently the response\npointer will be referring to a location past the expected\nbuffer boundaries allowing information leakage e.g. via\nRNDIS_OID_802_3_PERMANENT_ADDRESS OID.",
