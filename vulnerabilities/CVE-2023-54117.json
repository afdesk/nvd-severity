  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/dcssblk: fix kernel crash with list_add corruption\n\nCommit fb08a1908cb1 (\"dax: simplify the dax_device <-> gendisk\nassociation\") introduced new logic for gendisk association, requiring\ndrivers to explicitly call dax_add_host() and dax_remove_host().\n\nFor dcssblk driver, some dax_remove_host() calls were missing, e.g. in\ndevice remove path. The commit also broke error handling for out_dax case\nin device add path, resulting in an extra put_device() w/o the previous\nget_device() in that case.\n\nThis lead to stale xarray entries after device add / remove cycles. In the\ncase when a previously used struct gendisk pointer (xarray index) would be\nused again, because blk_alloc_disk() happened to return such a pointer, the\nxa_insert() in dax_add_host() would fail and go to out_dax, doing the extra\nput_device() in the error path. In combination with an already flawed error\nhandling in dcssblk (device_register() cleanup), which needs to be\naddressed in a separate patch, this resulted in a missing device_del() /\nklist_del(), and eventually in the kernel crash with list_add corruption on\na subsequent device_add() / klist_add().\n\nFix this by adding the missing dax_remove_host() calls, and also move the\nput_device() in the error path to restore the previous logic.",
