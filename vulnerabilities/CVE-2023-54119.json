  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninotify: Avoid reporting event with invalid wd\n\nWhen inotify_freeing_mark() races with inotify_handle_inode_event() it\ncan happen that inotify_handle_inode_event() sees that i_mark->wd got\nalready reset to -1 and reports this value to userspace which can\nconfuse the inotify listener. Avoid the problem by validating that wd is\nsensible (and pretend the mark got removed before the event got\ngenerated otherwise).",
