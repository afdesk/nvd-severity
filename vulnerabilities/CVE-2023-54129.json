  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteontx2-af: Add validation for lmac type\n\nUpon physical link change, firmware reports to the kernel about the\nchange along with the details like speed, lmac_type_id, etc.\nKernel derives lmac_type based on lmac_type_id received from firmware.\n\nIn a few scenarios, firmware returns an invalid lmac_type_id, which\nis resulting in below kernel panic. This patch adds the missing\nvalidation of the lmac_type_id field.\n\nInternal error: Oops: 96000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[   35.321595] Modules linked in:\n[   35.328982] CPU: 0 PID: 31 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted\n5.4.210-g2e3169d8e1bc-dirty #17\n[   35.337014] Hardware name: Marvell CN103XX board (DT)\n[   35.344297] Workqueue: events work_for_cpu_fn\n[   35.352730] pstate: 40400089 (nZcv daIf +PAN -UAO)\n[   35.360267] pc : strncpy+0x10/0x30\n[   35.366595] lr : cgx_link_change_handler+0x90/0x180",
