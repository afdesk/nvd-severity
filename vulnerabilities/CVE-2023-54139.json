  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing/user_events: Ensure write index cannot be negative\n\nThe write index indicates which event the data is for and accesses a\nper-file array. The index is passed by user processes during write()\ncalls as the first 4 bytes. Ensure that it cannot be negative by\nreturning -EINVAL to prevent out of bounds accesses.\n\nUpdate ftrace self-test to ensure this occurs properly.",
