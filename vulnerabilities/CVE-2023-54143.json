  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mediatek: vcodec: fix resource leaks in vdec_msg_queue_init()\n\nIf we encounter any error in the vdec_msg_queue_init() then we need\nto set \"msg_queue->wdma_addr.size = 0;\".  Normally, this is done\ninside the vdec_msg_queue_deinit() function.  However, if the\nfirst call to allocate &msg_queue->wdma_addr fails, then the\nvdec_msg_queue_deinit() function is a no-op.  For that situation, just\nset the size to zero explicitly and return.\n\nThere were two other error paths which did not clean up before returning.\nChange those error paths to goto mem_alloc_err.",
