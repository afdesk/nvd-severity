  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsfc: fix crash when reading stats while NIC is resetting\n\nefx_net_stats() (.ndo_get_stats64) can be called during an ethtool\n selftest, during which time nic_data->mc_stats is NULL as the NIC has\n been fini'd.  In this case do not attempt to fetch the latest stats\n from the hardware, else we will crash on a NULL dereference:\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000038\n    RIP efx_nic_update_stats\n    abridged calltrace:\n    efx_ef10_update_stats_pf\n    efx_net_stats\n    dev_get_stats\n    dev_seq_printf_stats\nSkipping the read is safe, we will simply give out stale stats.\nTo ensure that the free in efx_ef10_fini_nic() does not race against\n efx_ef10_update_stats_pf(), which could cause a TOCTTOU bug, take the\n efx->stats_lock in fini_nic (it is already held across update_stats).",
