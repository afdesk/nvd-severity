  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: xiic: xiic_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path\n\nThe xiic_xfer() function gets a runtime PM reference when the function is\nentered. This reference is released when the function is exited. There is\ncurrently one error path where the function exits directly, which leads to\na leak of the runtime PM reference.\n\nMake sure that this error path also releases the runtime PM reference.",
