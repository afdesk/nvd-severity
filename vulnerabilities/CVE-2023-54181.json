  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix issue in verifying allow_ptr_leaks\n\nAfter we converted the capabilities of our networking-bpf program from\ncap_sys_admin to cap_net_admin+cap_bpf, our networking-bpf program\nfailed to start. Because it failed the bpf verifier, and the error log\nis \"R3 pointer comparison prohibited\".\n\nA simple reproducer as follows,\n\nSEC(\"cls-ingress\")\nint ingress(struct __sk_buff *skb)\n{\n\tstruct iphdr *iph = (void *)(long)skb->data + sizeof(struct ethhdr);\n\n\tif ((long)(iph + 1) > (long)skb->data_end)\n\t\treturn TC_ACT_STOLEN;\n\treturn TC_ACT_OK;\n}\n\nPer discussion with Yonghong and Alexei [1], comparison of two packet\npointers is not a pointer leak. This patch fixes it.\n\nOur local kernel is 6.1.y and we expect this fix to be backported to\n6.1.y, so stable is CCed.\n\n[1]. https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/CAADnVQ+Nmspr7Si+pxWn8zkE7hX-7s93ugwC+94aXSy4uQ9vBg@mail.gmail.com/",
