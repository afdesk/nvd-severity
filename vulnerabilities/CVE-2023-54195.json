  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix timeout of a call that hasn't yet been granted a channel\n\nafs_make_call() calls rxrpc_kernel_begin_call() to begin a call (which may\nget stalled in the background waiting for a connection to become\navailable); it then calls rxrpc_kernel_set_max_life() to set the timeouts -\nbut that starts the call timer so the call timer might then expire before\nwe get a connection assigned - leading to the following oops if the call\nstalled:\n\n\tBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n\t...\n\tCPU: 1 PID: 5111 Comm: krxrpcio/0 Not tainted 6.3.0-rc7-build3+ #701\n\tRIP: 0010:rxrpc_alloc_txbuf+0xc0/0x157\n\t...\n\tCall Trace:\n\t <TASK>\n\t rxrpc_send_ACK+0x50/0x13b\n\t rxrpc_input_call_event+0x16a/0x67d\n\t rxrpc_io_thread+0x1b6/0x45f\n\t ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x1f/0x35\n\t ? rxrpc_input_packet+0x519/0x519\n\t kthread+0xe7/0xef\n\t ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x1b/0x1b\n\t ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30\n\nFix this by noting the timeouts in struct rxrpc_call when the call is\ncreated.  The timer will be started when the first packet is transmitted.\n\nIt shouldn't be possible to trigger this directly from userspace through\nAF_RXRPC as sendmsg() will return EBUSY if the call is in the\nwaiting-for-conn state if it dropped out of the wait due to a signal.",
