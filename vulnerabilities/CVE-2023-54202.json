  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915: fix race condition UAF in i915_perf_add_config_ioctl\n\nUserspace can guess the id value and try to race oa_config object creation\nwith config remove, resulting in a use-after-free if we dereference the\nobject after unlocking the metrics_lock.  For that reason, unlocking the\nmetrics_lock must be done after we are done dereferencing the object.\n\n[tursulin: Manually added stable tag.]\n(cherry picked from commit 49f6f6483b652108bcb73accd0204a464b922395)",
