  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_sync: Avoid use-after-free in dbg for hci_remove_adv_monitor()\n\nKASAN reports that there's a use-after-free in\nhci_remove_adv_monitor(). Trawling through the disassembly, you can\nsee that the complaint is from the access in bt_dev_dbg() under the\nHCI_ADV_MONITOR_EXT_MSFT case. The problem case happens because\nmsft_remove_monitor() can end up freeing the monitor\nstructure. Specifically:\n  hci_remove_adv_monitor() ->\n  msft_remove_monitor() ->\n  msft_remove_monitor_sync() ->\n  msft_le_cancel_monitor_advertisement_cb() ->\n  hci_free_adv_monitor()\n\nLet's fix the problem by just stashing the relevant data when it's\nstill valid.",
