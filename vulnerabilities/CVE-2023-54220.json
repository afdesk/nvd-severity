  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: 8250: Fix oops for port->pm on uart_change_pm()\n\nUnloading a hardware specific 8250 driver can produce error \"Unable to\nhandle kernel paging request at virtual address\" about ten seconds after\nunloading the driver. This happens on uart_hangup() calling\nuart_change_pm().\n\nTurns out commit 04e82793f068 (\"serial: 8250: Reinit port->pm on port\nspecific driver unbind\") was only a partial fix. If the hardware specific\ndriver has initialized port->pm function, we need to clear port->pm too.\nJust reinitializing port->ops does not do this. Otherwise serial8250_pm()\nwill call port->pm() instead of serial8250_do_pm().",
