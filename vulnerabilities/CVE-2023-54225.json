  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ipa: only reset hashed tables when supported\n\nLast year, the code that manages GSI channel transactions switched\nfrom using spinlock-protected linked lists to using indexes into the\nring buffer used for a channel.  Recently, Google reported seeing\ntransaction reference count underflows occasionally during shutdown.\n\nDoug Anderson found a way to reproduce the issue reliably, and\nbisected the issue to the commit that eliminated the linked lists\nand the lock.  The root cause was ultimately determined to be\nrelated to unused transactions being committed as part of the modem\nshutdown cleanup activity.  Unused transactions are not normally\nexpected (except in error cases).\n\nThe modem uses some ranges of IPA-resident memory, and whenever it\nshuts down we zero those ranges.  In ipa_filter_reset_table() a\ntransaction is allocated to zero modem filter table entries.  If\nhashing is not supported, hashed table memory should not be zeroed.\nBut currently nothing prevents that, and the result is an unused\ntransaction.  Something similar occurs when we zero routing table\nentries for the modem.\n\nBy preventing any attempt to clear hashed tables when hashing is not\nsupported, the reference count underflow is avoided in this case.\n\nNote that there likely remains an issue with properly freeing unused\ntransactions (if they occur due to errors).  This patch addresses\nonly the underflows that Google originally reported.",
