  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: raa215300: Fix resource leak in case of error\n\nThe clk_register_clkdev() allocates memory by calling vclkdev_alloc() and\nthis memory is not freed in the error path. Similarly, resources allocated\nby clk_register_fixed_rate() are not freed in the error path.\n\nFix these issues by using devm_clk_hw_register_fixed_rate() and\ndevm_clk_hw_register_clkdev().\n\nAfter this, the static variable clk is not needed. Replace it with\u00a0\nlocal variable hw in probe() and drop calling clk_unregister_fixed_rate()\nfrom raa215300_rtc_unregister_device().",
