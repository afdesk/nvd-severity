  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nm68k: Only force 030 bus error if PC not in exception table\n\n__get_kernel_nofault() does copy data in supervisor mode when\nforcing a task backtrace log through /proc/sysrq_trigger.\nThis is expected cause a bus error exception on e.g. NULL\npointer dereferencing when logging a kernel task has no\nworkqueue associated. This bus error ought to be ignored.\n\nOur 030 bus error handler is ill equipped to deal with this:\n\nWhenever ssw indicates a kernel mode access on a data fault,\nwe don't even attempt to handle the fault and instead always\nsend a SEGV signal (or panic). As a result, the check\nfor exception handling at the fault PC (buried in\nsend_sig_fault() which gets called from do_page_fault()\neventually) is never used.\n\nIn contrast, both 040 and 060 access error handlers do not\ncare whether a fault happened on supervisor mode access,\nand will call do_page_fault() on those, ultimately honoring\nthe exception table.\n\nAdd a check in bus_error030 to call do_page_fault() in case\nwe do have an entry for the fault PC in our exception table.\n\nI had attempted a fix for this earlier in 2019 that did rely\non testing pagefault_disabled() (see link below) to achieve\nthe same thing, but this patch should be more generic.\n\nTested on 030 Atari Falcon.",
