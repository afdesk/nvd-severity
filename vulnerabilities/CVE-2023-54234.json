  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: mpi3mr: Fix missing mrioc->evtack_cmds initialization\n\nCommit c1af985d27da (\"scsi: mpi3mr: Add Event acknowledgment logic\")\nintroduced an array mrioc->evtack_cmds but initialization of the array\nelements was missed. They are just zero cleared. The function\nmpi3mr_complete_evt_ack() refers host_tag field of the elements. Due to the\nzero value of the host_tag field, the function calls clear_bit() for\nmrico->evtack_cmds_bitmap with wrong bit index. This results in memory\naccess to invalid address and \"BUG: KASAN: use-after-free\". This BUG was\nobserved at eHBA-9600 firmware update to version 8.3.1.0. To fix it, add\nthe missing initialization of mrioc->evtack_cmds.",
