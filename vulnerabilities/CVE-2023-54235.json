  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/DOE: Fix destroy_work_on_stack() race\n\nThe following debug object splat was observed in testing:\n\n  ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: 0000000097d23782 object type: work_struct hint: doe_statemachine_work+0x0/0x510\n  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 71 at lib/debugobjects.c:514 debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0\n  ...\n  Workqueue: pci 0000:36:00.0 DOE [1 doe_statemachine_work\n  RIP: 0010:debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   ? debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0\n   ? __pfx_doe_statemachine_work+0x10/0x10\n   debug_object_free.part.0+0x11b/0x150\n   doe_statemachine_work+0x45e/0x510\n   process_one_work+0x1d4/0x3c0\n\nThis occurs because destroy_work_on_stack() was called after signaling\nthe completion in the calling thread.  This creates a race between\ndestroy_work_on_stack() and the task->work struct going out of scope in\npci_doe().\n\nSignal the work complete after destroying the work struct.  This is safe\nbecause signal_task_complete() is the final thing the work item does and\nthe workqueue code is careful not to access the work struct after.",
