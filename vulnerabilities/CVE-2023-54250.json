  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: avoid out of bounds access in decode_preauth_ctxt()\n\nConfirm that the accessed pneg_ctxt->HashAlgorithms address sits within\nthe SMB request boundary; deassemble_neg_contexts() only checks that the\neight byte smb2_neg_context header + (client controlled) DataLength are\nwithin the packet boundary, which is insufficient.\n\nChecking for sizeof(struct smb2_preauth_neg_context) is overkill given\nthat the type currently assumes SMB311_SALT_SIZE bytes of trailing Salt.",
