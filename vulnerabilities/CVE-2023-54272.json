  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ni_clear()\n\nIn a previous commit c1006bd13146, ni->mi.mrec in ni_write_inode()\ncould be NULL, and thus a NULL check is added for this variable.\n\nHowever, in the same call stack, ni->mi.mrec can be also dereferenced\nin ni_clear():\n\nntfs_evict_inode(inode)\n  ni_write_inode(inode, ...)\n    ni = ntfs_i(inode);\n    is_rec_inuse(ni->mi.mrec) -> Add a NULL check by previous commit\n  ni_clear(ntfs_i(inode))\n    is_rec_inuse(ni->mi.mrec) -> No check\n\nThus, a possible null-pointer dereference may exist in ni_clear().\nTo fix it, a NULL check is added in this function.",
