  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: av7110: prevent underflow in write_ts_to_decoder()\n\nThe buf[4] value comes from the user via ts_play().  It is a value in\nthe u8 range.  The final length we pass to av7110_ipack_instant_repack()\nis \"len - (buf[4] + 1) - 4\" so add a check to ensure that the length is\nnot negative.  It's not clear that passing a negative len value does\nanything bad necessarily, but it's not best practice.\n\nWith the new bounds checking the \"if (!len)\" condition is no longer\npossible or required so remove that.",
