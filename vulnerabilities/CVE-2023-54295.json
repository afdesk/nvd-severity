  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmtd: spi-nor: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in spi_nor_set_erase_type\n\nspi_nor_set_erase_type() was used either to set or to mask out an erase\ntype. When we used it to mask out an erase type a shift-out-of-bounds\nwas hit:\nUBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/core.c:2237:24\nshift exponent 4294967295 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'\n\nThe setting of the size_{shift, mask} and of the opcode are unnecessary\nwhen the erase size is zero, as throughout the code just the erase size\nis considered to determine whether an erase type is supported or not.\nSetting the opcode to 0xFF was wrong too as nobody guarantees that 0xFF\nis an unused opcode. Thus when masking out an erase type, just set the\nerase size to zero. This will fix the shift-out-of-bounds.\n\n[ta: refine changes, new commit message, fix compilation error]",
