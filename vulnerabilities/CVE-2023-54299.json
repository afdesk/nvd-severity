  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: typec: bus: verify partner exists in typec_altmode_attention\n\nSome usb hubs will negotiate DisplayPort Alt mode with the device\nbut will then negotiate a data role swap after entering the alt\nmode. The data role swap causes the device to unregister all alt\nmodes, however the usb hub will still send Attention messages\neven after failing to reregister the Alt Mode. type_altmode_attention\ncurrently does not verify whether or not a device's altmode partner\nexists, which results in a NULL pointer error when dereferencing\nthe typec_altmode and typec_altmode_ops belonging to the altmode\npartner.\n\nVerify the presence of a device's altmode partner before sending\nthe Attention message to the Alt Mode driver.",
