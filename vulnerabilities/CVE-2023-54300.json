  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath9k: avoid referencing uninit memory in ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx\n\nFor the reasons also described in commit b383e8abed41 (\"wifi: ath9k: avoid\nuninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()\"), ath9k_htc_rx_msg() should\nvalidate pkt_len before accessing the SKB.\n\nFor example, the obtained SKB may have been badly constructed with\npkt_len = 8. In this case, the SKB can only contain a valid htc_frame_hdr\nbut after being processed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() and passed to\nath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx() endpoint RX handler, it is expected to have a WMI\ncommand header which should be located inside its data payload.\n\nImplement sanity checking inside ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx(). Otherwise, uninit\nmemory can be referenced.\n\nTested on Qualcomm Atheros Communications AR9271 802.11n .\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
