  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Disable preemption in bpf_perf_event_output\n\nThe nesting protection in bpf_perf_event_output relies on disabled\npreemption, which is guaranteed for kprobes and tracepoints.\n\nHowever bpf_perf_event_output can be also called from uprobes context\nthrough bpf_prog_run_array_sleepable function which disables migration,\nbut keeps preemption enabled.\n\nThis can cause task to be preempted by another one inside the nesting\nprotection and lead eventually to two tasks using same perf_sample_data\nbuffer and cause crashes like:\n\n  kernel tried to execute NX-protected page - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)\n  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff82be3eea\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   ? __die+0x1f/0x70\n   ? page_fault_oops+0x176/0x4d0\n   ? exc_page_fault+0x132/0x230\n   ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n   ? perf_output_sample+0x12b/0x910\n   ? perf_event_output+0xd0/0x1d0\n   ? bpf_perf_event_output+0x162/0x1d0\n   ? bpf_prog_c6271286d9a4c938_krava1+0x76/0x87\n   ? __uprobe_perf_func+0x12b/0x540\n   ? uprobe_dispatcher+0x2c4/0x430\n   ? uprobe_notify_resume+0x2da/0xce0\n   ? atomic_notifier_call_chain+0x7b/0x110\n   ? exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x13e/0x290\n   ? irqentry_exit_to_user_mode+0x5/0x30\n   ? asm_exc_int3+0x35/0x40\n\nFixing this by disabling preemption in bpf_perf_event_output.",
