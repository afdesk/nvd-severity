  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: af9005: Fix null-ptr-deref in af9005_i2c_xfer\n\nIn af9005_i2c_xfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf\nis null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would be\npassed. Malicious data finally reach af9005_i2c_xfer. If accessing\nmsg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.\nWe add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.\n\nSimilar commit:\ncommit 0ed554fd769a\n(\"media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()\")",
