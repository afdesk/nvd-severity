  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/powernv/sriov: perform null check on iov before dereferencing iov\n\nCurrently pointer iov is being dereferenced before the null check of iov\nwhich can lead to null pointer dereference errors. Fix this by moving the\niov null check before the dereferencing.\n\nDetected using cppcheck static analysis:\nlinux/arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/pci-sriov.c:597:12: warning: Either\nthe condition '!iov' is redundant or there is possible null pointer\ndereference: iov. [nullPointerRedundantCheck]\n num_vfs = iov->num_vfs;\n           ^",
