  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndriver core: fix potential null-ptr-deref in device_add()\n\nI got the following null-ptr-deref report while doing fault injection test:\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058\nCPU: 2 PID: 278 Comm: 37-i2c-ds2482 Tainted: G    B   W        N 6.1.0-rc3+\nRIP: 0010:klist_put+0x2d/0xd0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n klist_remove+0xf1/0x1c0\n device_release_driver_internal+0x196/0x210\n bus_remove_device+0x1bd/0x240\n device_add+0xd3d/0x1100\n w1_add_master_device+0x476/0x490 [wire]\n ds2482_probe+0x303/0x3e0 [ds2482]\n\nThis is how it happened:\n\nw1_alloc_dev()\n  // The dev->driver is set to w1_master_driver.\n  memcpy(&dev->dev, device, sizeof(struct device));\n  device_add()\n    bus_add_device()\n    dpm_sysfs_add() // It fails, calls bus_remove_device.\n\n    // error path\n    bus_remove_device()\n      // The dev->driver is not null, but driver is not bound.\n      __device_release_driver()\n        klist_remove(&dev->p->knode_driver) <-- It causes null-ptr-deref.\n\n    // normal path\n    bus_probe_device() // It's not called yet.\n      device_bind_driver()\n\nIf dev->driver is set, in the error path after calling bus_add_device()\nin device_add(), bus_remove_device() is called, then the device will be\ndetached from driver. But device_bind_driver() is not called yet, so it\ncauses null-ptr-deref while access the 'knode_driver'. To fix this, set\ndev->driver to null in the error path before calling bus_remove_device().",
