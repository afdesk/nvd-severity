  "Description": "\nThe 1E-Exchange-DisplayMessageinstruction that is part of the End-User Interaction product pack available on the 1E Exchange does not properly validate the Caption or Message parameters, which allows for a specially crafted input to perform arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM permissions.\n\nTo remediate this issue DELETE the instruction\u00a0\u201cShow dialogue with caption %Caption% and message %Message%\u201d from the list of instructions in the Settings UI, and replace it with the new instruction\u00a01E-Exchange-ShowNotification instruction available in the updated End-User Interaction product pack. The new instruction should show as\u00a0\u201cShow %Type% type notification with header %Header% and message %Message%\u201d with a version of 7.1 or above.",
