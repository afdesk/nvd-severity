  "Description": "In versions of FreeBSD 13-RELEASE before 13-RELEASE-p5, under certain circumstances the cap_net libcasper(3) service incorrectly validates that updated constraints are strictly subsets of the active constraints. \u00a0When only a list\u00a0of resolvable domain names was specified without setting any other limitations, an application could submit a new list of domains including include entries not previously listed. \u00a0This could permit the application to resolve domain names that were previously restricted.",
