  "Description": "The Duplicator WordPress plugin before 1.5.7.1, Duplicator Pro WordPress plugin before 4.5.14.2 does not disallow listing the `backups-dup-lite/tmp` directory (or the `backups-dup-pro/tmp` directory in the Pro version), which temporarily stores files containing sensitive data. When directory listing is enabled in the web server, this allows unauthenticated attackers to discover and access these sensitive files, which include a full database dump and a zip archive of the site.",
