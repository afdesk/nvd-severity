  "Description": "As a simple library, class.upload.php does not perform an in-depth check on uploaded files, allowing a stored XSS vulnerability when the default configuration is used. \n\n\nDevelopers must be aware of that fact and use extension whitelisting accompanied by forcing the server to always provide content-type based on the file extension. \n\n\nThe README has been updated to include these guidelines.",
