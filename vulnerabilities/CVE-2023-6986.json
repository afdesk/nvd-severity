  "Description": "The EmbedPress \u2013 Embed PDF, YouTube, Google Docs, Vimeo, Wistia Videos, Audios, Maps & Any Documents in Gutenberg & Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's embed_oembed_html shortcode in all versions up to 3.9.5 (exclusive) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
