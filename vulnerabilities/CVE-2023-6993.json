  "Description": "The Custom post types, Custom Fields & more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode and custom post meta in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied post meta values. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
