  "Description": "Anheng Mingyu Operation and Maintenance Audit and Risk Control System up to 2023-08-10 contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the xmlrpc.sock handler. The product accepts specially crafted XML-RPC requests that can be used to instruct the server to connect to internal unix socket RPC endpoints\u00a0and perform privileged XML-RPC methods. An attacker able to send such requests can invoke administrative RPC methods via the unix socket interface to create arbitrary user accounts on the system, resulting in account creation and potential takeover of the bastion host.\u00a0VulnCheck has observed this vulnerability being exploited in the wild as of 2025-10-30 at 00:30:17.837319 UTC.",
