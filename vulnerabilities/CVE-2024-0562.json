  "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister is called to stop further write-back and waits for associated delayed work to complete. However, wb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation work after this has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the recently freed bdi_writeback.",
