  "Description": "The The Notibar \u2013 Notification Bar for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via njt_nofi_text AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.",
