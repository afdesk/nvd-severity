  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in `podman build` and `buildah.` This issue occurs in a container breakout by using --jobs=2 and a race condition when building a malicious Containerfile. SELinux might mitigate it, but even with SELinux on, it still allows the enumeration of files and directories on the host.",
