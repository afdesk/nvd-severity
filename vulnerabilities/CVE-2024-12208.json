  "Description": "The Backup and Restore WordPress \u2013 Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.50. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_queue_manual_backup() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger backups via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
