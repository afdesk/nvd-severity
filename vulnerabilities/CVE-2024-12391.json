  "Description": "A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic, as of commit 310122f, allows for a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The function '\u89e3\u6790\u9879\u76ee\u6e90\u7801\uff08\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u6e90\u7801\u6587\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\uff09' permits the execution of user-provided regular expressions. Certain regular expressions can cause the Python RE engine to take exponential time to execute, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An attacker who controls both the regular expression and the search string can exploit this vulnerability to hang the server for an arbitrary amount of time.",
