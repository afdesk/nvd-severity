  "Description": "The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin \u2013 Super Socializer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited SQL Injection via the \u2018SuperSocializerKey\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.14 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional values into the already existing query that can be used to extract user metadata from the database.",
