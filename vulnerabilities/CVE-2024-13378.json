  "Description": "The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018style_settings\u2019 parameter in versions 2.9.0.1 up to, and including, 2.9.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

The attack is only successful in the Chrome web browser, and requires directly browsing the media file via the attachment post.",
