  "Description": "The ProductDyno plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018res\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.24 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This vulnerability is potentially a duplicate of CVE-2025-22320.",
