  "Description": "The The Motors - Car Dealer, Rental & Listing WordPress theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.65. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.\r\n\r\n*It is unclear exactly which version the issue was patched in from the changelog. Therefore, we used the latest version at the time of verification.",
