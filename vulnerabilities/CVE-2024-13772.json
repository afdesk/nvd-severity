  "Description": "The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.6.1. This is due to a lack of password randomization and user validation through the fb_ajax_login_or_register and google_ajax_login_or_register actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user as long as they have access to the email.",
