  "Description": "Bitdefender Box, versions 1.3.11.490 through 1.3.11.505, uses the insecure HTTP protocol to download assets over the Internet to update and restart daemons and detection rules on the devices. Updates can be remotely triggered through the /set_temp_token API method. Then, an unauthenticated and network-adjacent attacker can use man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques to return malicious responses. Restarted daemons that use malicious assets can then be exploited for remote code execution on the device.",
