  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to < 2024R1.1.2 are vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via the login page when accessed with older web browsers. Insufficient validation or escaping of user-supplied input reflected by the login page can allow an attacker to craft a malicious link that, when visited by a victim, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim\u2019s browser within the Nagios XI origin.\u00a0The issue is observable under legacy browser behaviors; modern browsers may mitigate some vectors.",
