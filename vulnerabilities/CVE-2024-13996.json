  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to\u00a02024R1.1.3\u00a0did not invalidate all other active sessions for a user when that user's password was changed. As a result, any pre-existing sessions (including those potentially controlled by an attacker) remained valid after a credential update. This insufficient session expiration could allow continued unauthorized access to user data and actions even after a password change.",
