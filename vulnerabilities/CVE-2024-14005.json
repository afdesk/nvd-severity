  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.2 contain a command injection vulnerability in the Docker Wizard. Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the wizard allows an authenticated administrator to inject shell metacharacters that are incorporated into backend command invocations. Successful exploitation enables arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the Nagios XI web application user.",
