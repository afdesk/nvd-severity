  "Description": "LlamaIndex (run-llama/llama_index) versions up to and including 0.11.6 contain an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in BGEM3Index.load_from_disk() in llama_index/indices/managed/bge_m3/base.py. The function uses pickle.load() to deserialize multi_embed_store.pkl from a user-supplied persist_dir without validation. An attacker who can provide a crafted persist directory containing a malicious pickle file can trigger arbitrary code execution when the victim loads the index from disk.",
