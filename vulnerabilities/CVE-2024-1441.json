  "Description": "An off-by-one error flaw was found in the udevListInterfacesByStatus() function in libvirt when the number of interfaces exceeds the size of the `names` array. This issue can be reproduced by sending specially crafted data to the libvirt daemon, allowing an unprivileged client to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.",
