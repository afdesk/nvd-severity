  "Description": "Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then \ntruncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the \norder of the elliptic curve. Meaning k = r mod n. The division used \nduring the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the upper two \ndigits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit of \nn and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size. \nObserving the number of times q_e is decremented through a control-flow \nrevealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of \nk. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a \nsignificant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction \nmethods. For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits.",
