  "Description": "A search path or unquoted item vulnerability in Faronics Deep Freeze Server Standard, which affects versions 8.30.020.4627 and earlier. This vulnerability affects the DFServ.exe file.\u00a0An attacker with local user privileges could exploit this vulnerability to replace the legitimate DFServ.exe service executable with a malicious file of the same name and located in a directory that has a higher priority than the legitimate directory.\u00a0Thus, when the service starts, it will run the malicious file instead of the legitimate executable, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access to the compromised system or stop the service from running.",
