  "Description": "The WP-DB-Table-Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data, modification of data, and loss of data due to lack of a default capability requirement on the 'dbte_render' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify database tables that the theme has been configured to use the plugin to edit.",
