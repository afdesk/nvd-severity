  "Description": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the rate filtering feature of the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured rate limiting filter.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an incorrect connection count comparison. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device at a rate that exceeds a configured rate filter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to successfully bypass the rate filter. This could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device.",
