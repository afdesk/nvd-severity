  "Description": "A vulnerability in the Network Service Group (NSG) feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured access control list (ACL) and allow traffic that should be denied to flow through an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when NSG ACLs are populated on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL rules.",
