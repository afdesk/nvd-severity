  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid admin credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system.",
