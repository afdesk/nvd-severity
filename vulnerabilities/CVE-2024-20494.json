  "Description": "A vulnerability in the TLS cryptography functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper data validation during the TLS 1.3 handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS 1.3 packet to an affected system through a TLS 1.3-enabled listening socket. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability can also impact the integrity of a device by causing VPN HostScan communication failures or file transfer failures when Cisco ASA Software is upgraded using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).",
