  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 with Cisco Multiplatform Firmware could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web UI of an affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, Web Access must be enabled on the phone and the attacker must have Admin credentials on the device. Web Access is disabled by default.",
