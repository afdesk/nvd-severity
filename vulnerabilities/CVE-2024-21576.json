  "Description": "ComfyUI-Bmad-Nodes is vulnerable to Code Injection. The issue stems from a validation bypass in the BuildColorRangeHSVAdvanced, FilterContour and FindContour custom nodes. In the entrypoint function to each node, there\u2019s a call to eval which can be triggered by generating a workflow that injects a crafted string into the node. This can result in executing arbitrary code on the server.",
