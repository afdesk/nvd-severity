  "Description": "\nAn Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Nonstop active routing (NSR) component of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause memory leak leading to Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS platforms, when NSR is enabled, a BGP flap will cause memory leak. A manual reboot of the system will restore the services.\n\nNote: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.\nThe memory usage can be monitored using the below commands.\n\nuser@host> show chassis routing-engine no-forwarding\nuser@host> show system memory | no-more\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S5;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S4;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S2;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S2;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S1, 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R1-S2, 22.4R2.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Junos OS versions earlier than 20.4R3-S7.\n\n\n\n",
