  "Description": "cdo-local-uuid project provides a specialized UUID-generating function that can, on user request, cause a program to generate deterministic UUIDs. An information leakage vulnerability is present in `cdo-local-uuid` at version `0.4.0`, and in `case-utils` in unpatched versions (matching the pattern `0.x.0`) at and since `0.5.0`, before `0.15.0`. The vulnerability stems from a Python function, `cdo_local_uuid.local_uuid()`, and its original implementation `case_utils.local_uuid()`. ",
