  "Description": "ThreeTen Backport v1.6.8 was discovered to contain an integer overflow via the component org.threeten.bp.format.DateTimeFormatter::parse(CharSequence, ParsePosition). NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.
