  "Description": "The Pixee Java Code Security Toolkit is a set of security APIs meant to help secure Java code. `ZipSecurity#isBelowCurrentDirectory` is vulnerable to a partial-path traversal bypass. To be vulnerable to the bypass, the application must use toolkit version <=1.1.1, use ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit path. Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories (e.g., /etc/), it will allow \"escaping\" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-something-else. This vulnerability is patched in 1.1.2.\n\n",
