  "Description": "CasaOS-UserService provides user management functionalities to CasaOS. Starting in version 0.4.4.3 and prior to version 0.4.7, CasaOS doesn't defend against password brute force attacks, which leads to having full access to the server. The web application lacks control over the login attempts. This vulnerability allows attackers to get super user-level access over the server. Version 0.4.7 contains a patch for this issue.",
