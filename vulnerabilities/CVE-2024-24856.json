  "Description": "The memory allocation function ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED does not guarantee a\nsuccessful allocation, but the subsequent code directly dereferences the\npointer that receives it, which may lead to null pointer dereference.\n\nTo fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null, \nreturn exception code AE_NO_MEMORY.\n\n",
