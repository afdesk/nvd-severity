  "Description": "The WP Mobile Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_menu_item_icon function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.4.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add the '_mobmenu_icon' post meta to arbitrary posts with an arbitrary (but sanitized) value. NOTE: Version 2.8.4.4 contains a partial fix for this vulnerability.",
