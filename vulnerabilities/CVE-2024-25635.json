  "Description": "alf.io is an open source ticket reservation system. Prior to version 2.0-Mr-2402, organization owners can view the generated API KEY and USERS of other organization owners using the `http://192.168.26.128:8080/admin/api/users/<user_id>` endpoint, which exposes the details of the provided user ID. This may also expose the API KEY in the username of the user. Version 2.0-M4-2402 fixes this issue.",
