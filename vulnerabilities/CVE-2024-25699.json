  "Description": "There is a difficult\u2011to\u2011exploit improper authentication issue in the Home application for Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 11.2 and below on Windows and Linux, and ArcGIS Enterprise versions 11.1 and below on Kubernetes, which under unique circumstances could allow a remote, authenticated attacker with low\u2011privileged access to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the software. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to cross an authentication and authorization boundary beyond their originally assigned access, resulting in a scope change.",
