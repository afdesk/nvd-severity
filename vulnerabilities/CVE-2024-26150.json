  "Description": "`@backstage/backend-common` is a common functionality library for backends for Backstage, an open platform for building developer portals. In `@backstage/backend-common` prior to versions 0.21.1, 0.20.2, and 0.19.10, paths checks with the `resolveSafeChildPath` utility were not exhaustive enough, leading to risk of path traversal vulnerabilities if symlinks can be injected by attackers. This issue is patched in `@backstage/backend-common` versions 0.21.1, 0.20.2, and 0.19.10.",
