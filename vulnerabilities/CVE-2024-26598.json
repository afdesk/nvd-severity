  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache\n\nThere is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation\ncache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such\nas a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that\nvgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq\nbefore dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.\n\nHave vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq\nand add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.",
