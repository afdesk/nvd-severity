  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: reject QUEUE/DROP verdict parameters\n\nThis reverts commit e0abdadcc6e1.\n\ncore.c:nf_hook_slow assumes that the upper 16 bits of NF_DROP\nverdicts contain a valid errno, i.e. -EPERM, -EHOSTUNREACH or similar,\nor 0.\n\nDue to the reverted commit, its possible to provide a positive\nvalue, e.g. NF_ACCEPT (1), which results in use-after-free.\n\nIts not clear to me why this commit was made.\n\nNF_QUEUE is not used by nftables; \"queue\" rules in nftables\nwill result in use of \"nft_queue\" expression.\n\nIf we later need to allow specifiying errno values from userspace\n(do not know why), this has to call NF_DROP_GETERR and check that\n\"err <= 0\" holds true.",
