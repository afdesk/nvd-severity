  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()\n\nSince tomoyo_write_control() updates head->write_buf when write()\nof long lines is requested, we need to fetch head->write_buf after\nhead->io_sem is held.  Otherwise, concurrent write() requests can\ncause use-after-free-write and double-free problems.",
