  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: arm64: Fix circular locking dependency\n\nThe rule inside kvm enforces that the vcpu->mutex is taken *inside*\nkvm->lock. The rule is violated by the pkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquires\nthe kvm->lock while already holding the vcpu->mutex lock from\nkvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular locking dependency altogether by\nprotecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock, much like we already\ndo for other forms of VM-scoped data.",
