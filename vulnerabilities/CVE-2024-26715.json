  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: gadget: Fix NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend\n\nIn current scenario if Plug-out and Plug-In performed continuously\nthere could be a chance while checking for dwc->gadget_driver in\ndwc3_gadget_suspend, a NULL pointer dereference may occur.\n\nCall Stack:\n\n\tCPU1:                           CPU2:\n\tgadget_unbind_driver            dwc3_suspend_common\n\tdwc3_gadget_stop                dwc3_gadget_suspend\n                                        dwc3_disconnect_gadget\n\nCPU1 basically clears the variable and CPU2 checks the variable.\nConsider CPU1 is running and right before gadget_driver is cleared\nand in parallel CPU2 executes dwc3_gadget_suspend where it finds\ndwc->gadget_driver which is not NULL and resumes execution and then\nCPU1 completes execution. CPU2 executes dwc3_disconnect_gadget where\nit checks dwc->gadget_driver is already NULL because of which the\nNULL pointer deference occur.",
