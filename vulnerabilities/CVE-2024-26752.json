  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nl2tp: pass correct message length to ip6_append_data\n\nl2tp_ip6_sendmsg needs to avoid accounting for the transport header\ntwice when splicing more data into an already partially-occupied skbuff.\n\nTo manage this, we check whether the skbuff contains data using\nskb_queue_empty when deciding how much data to append using\nip6_append_data.\n\nHowever, the code which performed the calculation was incorrect:\n\n     ulen = len + skb_queue_empty(&sk->sk_write_queue) ? transhdrlen : 0;\n\n...due to C operator precedence, this ends up setting ulen to\ntranshdrlen for messages with a non-zero length, which results in\ncorrupted packets on the wire.\n\nAdd parentheses to correct the calculation in line with the original\nintent.",
