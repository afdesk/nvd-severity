  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: Don't ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery()\n\nmddev_suspend() never stop sync_thread, hence it doesn't make sense to\nignore suspended array in md_check_recovery(), which might cause\nsync_thread can't be unregistered.\n\nAfter commit f52f5c71f3d4 (\"md: fix stopping sync thread\"), following\nhang can be triggered by test shell/integrity-caching.sh:\n\n1) suspend the array:\nraid_postsuspend\n mddev_suspend\n\n2) stop the array:\nraid_dtr\n md_stop\n  __md_stop_writes\n   stop_sync_thread\n    set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_INTR, &mddev->recovery);\n    md_wakeup_thread_directly(mddev->sync_thread);\n    wait_event(..., !test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery))\n\n3) sync thread done:\nmd_do_sync\n set_bit(MD_RECOVERY_DONE, &mddev->recovery);\n md_wakeup_thread(mddev->thread);\n\n4) daemon thread can't unregister sync thread:\nmd_check_recovery\n if (mddev->suspended)\n   return; -> return directly\n md_read_sync_thread\n clear_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery);\n -> MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING can't be cleared, hence step 2 hang;\n\nThis problem is not just related to dm-raid, fix it by ignoring\nsuspended array in md_check_recovery(). And follow up patches will\nimprove dm-raid better to frozen sync thread during suspend.",
