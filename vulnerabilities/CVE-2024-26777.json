  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: sis: Error out if pixclock equals zero\n\nThe userspace program could pass any values to the driver through\nioctl() interface. If the driver doesn't check the value of pixclock,\nit may cause divide-by-zero error.\n\nIn sisfb_check_var(), var->pixclock is used as a divisor to caculate\ndrate before it is checked against zero. Fix this by checking it\nat the beginning.\n\nThis is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed by\ncommit 15cf0b8.",
