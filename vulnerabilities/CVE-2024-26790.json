  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: fsl-qdma: fix SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read\n\nThere is chip (ls1028a) errata:\n\nThe SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read transactions by QDMA.\n\nUnaligned read transactions initiated by QDMA may stall in the NOC\n(Network On-Chip), causing a deadlock condition. Stalled transactions will\ntrigger completion timeouts in PCIe controller.\n\nWorkaround:\nEnable prefetch by setting the source descriptor prefetchable bit\n( SD[PF] = 1 ).\n\nImplement this workaround.",
