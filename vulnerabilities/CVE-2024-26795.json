  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: Sparse-Memory/vmemmap out-of-bounds fix\n\nOffset vmemmap so that the first page of vmemmap will be mapped\nto the first page of physical memory in order to ensure that\nvmemmap\u2019s bounds will be respected during\npfn_to_page()/page_to_pfn() operations.\nThe conversion macros will produce correct SV39/48/57 addresses\nfor every possible/valid DRAM_BASE inside the physical memory limits.\n\nv2:Address Alex's comments",
