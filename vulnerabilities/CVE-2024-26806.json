  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks\n\nThe ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not\nexpected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume().\nRemove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.\n\nThose helpers have two roles currently:\n - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker.\n - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It\n   requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.\n\nStep one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two\nhowever has two implications:\n - A deadlock occurs, because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context\n   where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback, where\n   the usage count is incremented).\n - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.\n\nHere is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:\n\nspi_mem_exec_op()\n        ...\n        spi_mem_access_start()\n                mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)\n\n        cqspi_exec_mem_op()\n                pm_runtime_resume_and_get()\n                        cqspi_resume()\n                                spi_controller_resume()\n                                        mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)\n                ...\n\n        spi_mem_access_end()\n                mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)\n        ...",
