  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: cadence-qspi: fix pointer reference in runtime PM hooks\n\ndev_get_drvdata() gets used to acquire the pointer to cqspi and the SPI\ncontroller. Neither embed the other; this lead to memory corruption.\n\nOn a given platform (Mobileye EyeQ5) the memory corruption is hidden\ninside cqspi->f_pdata. Also, this uninitialised memory is used as a\nmutex (ctlr->bus_lock_mutex) by spi_controller_suspend().",
