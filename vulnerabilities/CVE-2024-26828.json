  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()\n\nIn this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item we check\nif the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However,\nthe problem is that \"bytes_left\" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is type\nsize_t.  That means that because of type promotion, the comparison is\ndone as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left the loop\ncontinues instead of ending.",
