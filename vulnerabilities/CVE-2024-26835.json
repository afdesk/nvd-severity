  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: set dormant flag on hook register failure\n\nWe need to set the dormant flag again if we fail to register\nthe hooks.\n\nDuring memory pressure hook registration can fail and we end up\nwith a table marked as active but no registered hooks.\n\nOn table/base chain deletion, nf_tables will attempt to unregister\nthe hook again which yields a warn splat from the nftables core.",
