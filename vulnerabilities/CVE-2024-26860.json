  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-integrity: fix a memory leak when rechecking the data\n\nMemory for the \"checksums\" pointer will leak if the data is rechecked\nafter checksum failure (because the associated kfree won't happen due\nto 'goto skip_io').\n\nFix this by freeing the checksums memory before recheck, and just use\nthe \"checksum_onstack\" memory for storing checksum during recheck.",
