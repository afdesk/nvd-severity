  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/srpt: Do not register event handler until srpt device is fully setup\n\nUpon rare occasions, KASAN reports a use-after-free Write\nin srpt_refresh_port().\n\nThis seems to be because an event handler is registered before the\nsrpt device is fully setup and a race condition upon error may leave a\npartially setup event handler in place.\n\nInstead, only register the event handler after srpt device initialization\nis complete.",
