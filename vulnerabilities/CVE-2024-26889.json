  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_core: Fix possible buffer overflow\n\nstruct hci_dev_info has a fixed size name[8] field so in the event that\nhdev->name is bigger than that strcpy would attempt to write past its\nsize, so this fixes this problem by switching to use strscpy.",
