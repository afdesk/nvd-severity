  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: fix incorrect mpc_combine array size\n\n[why]\nMAX_SURFACES is per stream, while MAX_PLANES is per asic. The\nmpc_combine is an array that records all the planes per asic. Therefore\nMAX_PLANES should be used as the array size. Using MAX_SURFACES causes\narray overflow when there are more than 3 planes.\n\n[how]\nUse the MAX_PLANES for the mpc_combine array size.",
