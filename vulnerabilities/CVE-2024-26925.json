  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: release mutex after nft_gc_seq_end from abort path\n\nThe commit mutex should not be released during the critical section\nbetween nft_gc_seq_begin() and nft_gc_seq_end(), otherwise, async GC\nworker could collect expired objects and get the released commit lock\nwithin the same GC sequence.\n\nnf_tables_module_autoload() temporarily releases the mutex to load\nmodule dependencies, then it goes back to replay the transaction again.\nMove it at the end of the abort phase after nft_gc_seq_end() is called.",
