  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: iaa - Fix nr_cpus < nr_iaa case\n\nIf nr_cpus < nr_iaa, the calculated cpus_per_iaa will be 0, which\ncauses a divide-by-0 in rebalance_wq_table().\n\nMake sure cpus_per_iaa is 1 in that case, and also in the nr_iaa == 0\ncase, even though cpus_per_iaa is never used if nr_iaa == 0, for\nparanoia.",
