  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer\n\nThe previous commit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer->device being\ndereferenced. It's actually easier and faster performance-wise to\ninstead get the device from ctx->wg. This semantically makes more sense\ntoo, since ctx->wg->peer_allowedips.seq is compared with\nctx->allowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx. This also acts as a\ndefence in depth provision against freed peers.",
