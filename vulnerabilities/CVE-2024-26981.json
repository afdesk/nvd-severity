  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix OOB in nilfs_set_de_type\n\nThe size of the nilfs_type_by_mode array in the fs/nilfs2/dir.c file is\ndefined as \"S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT\", but the nilfs_set_de_type() function,\nwhich uses this array, specifies the index to read from the array in the\nsame way as \"(mode & S_IFMT) >> S_SHIFT\".\n\nstatic void nilfs_set_de_type(struct nilfs_dir_entry *de, struct inode\n *inode)\n{\n\tumode_t mode = inode->i_mode;\n\n\tde->file_type = nilfs_type_by_mode[(mode & S_IFMT)>>S_SHIFT]; // oob\n}\n\nHowever, when the index is determined this way, an out-of-bounds (OOB)\nerror occurs by referring to an index that is 1 larger than the array size\nwhen the condition \"mode & S_IFMT == S_IFMT\" is satisfied.  Therefore, a\npatch to resize the nilfs_type_by_mode array should be applied to prevent\nOOB errors.",
