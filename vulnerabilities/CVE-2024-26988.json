  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninit/main.c: Fix potential static_command_line memory overflow\n\nWe allocate memory of size 'xlen + strlen(boot_command_line) + 1' for\nstatic_command_line, but the strings copied into static_command_line are\nextra_command_line and command_line, rather than extra_command_line and\nboot_command_line.\n\nWhen strlen(command_line) > strlen(boot_command_line), static_command_line\nwill overflow.\n\nThis patch just recovers strlen(command_line) which was miss-consolidated\nwith strlen(boot_command_line) in the commit f5c7310ac73e (\"init/main: add\nchecks for the return value of memblock_alloc*()\")",
