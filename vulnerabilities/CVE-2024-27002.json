  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probe\n\nmt8183-mfgcfg has a mutual dependency with genpd during the probing\nstage, which leads to a deadlock in the following call stack:\n\nCPU0:  genpd_lock --> clk_prepare_lock\ngenpd_power_off_work_fn()\n genpd_lock()\n generic_pm_domain::power_off()\n    clk_unprepare()\n      clk_prepare_lock()\n\nCPU1: clk_prepare_lock --> genpd_lock\nclk_register()\n  __clk_core_init()\n    clk_prepare_lock()\n    clk_pm_runtime_get()\n      genpd_lock()\n\nDo a runtime PM get at the probe function to make sure clk_register()\nwon't acquire the genpd lock. Instead of only modifying mt8183-mfgcfg,\ndo this on all mediatek clock controller probings because we don't\nbelieve this would cause any regression.\n\nVerified on MT8183 and MT8192 Chromebooks.",
