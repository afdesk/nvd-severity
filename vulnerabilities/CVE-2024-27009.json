  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/cio: fix race condition during online processing\n\nA race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the\nonline process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent\nstate. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online fail\nwith return code ENODEV.\n\nThe problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after\na wait for final device state completed, but before the result state\nis evaluated.\n\nFix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between\ndetermining final state and checking result state.\n\nNote that since:\n\ncommit 2297791c92d0 (\"s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers\")\n\npath verification requests are much more likely to occur during boot,\nresulting in an increased chance of this race condition occurring.",
