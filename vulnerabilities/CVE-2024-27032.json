  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: fix to avoid potential panic during recovery\n\nDuring recovery, if FAULT_BLOCK is on, it is possible that\nf2fs_reserve_new_block() will return -ENOSPC during recovery,\nthen it may trigger panic.\n\nAlso, if fault injection rate is 1 and only FAULT_BLOCK fault\ntype is on, it may encounter deadloop in loop of block reservation.\n\nLet's change as below to fix these issues:\n- remove bug_on() to avoid panic.\n- limit the loop count of block reservation to avoid potential\ndeadloop.",
