  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: hisilicon: hi3559a: Fix an erroneous devm_kfree()\n\n'p_clk' is an array allocated just before the for loop for all clk that\nneed to be registered.\nIt is incremented at each loop iteration.\n\nIf a clk_register() call fails, 'p_clk' may point to something different\nfrom what should be freed.\n\nThe best we can do, is to avoid this wrong release of memory.",
