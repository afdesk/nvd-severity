  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Fix potential out-of-bounds access in 'amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init()'\n\nThe issue arises when the array 'adev->vcn.vcn_config' is accessed\nbefore checking if the index 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' is within the\nbounds of the array.\n\nThe fix involves moving the bounds check before the array access. This\nensures that 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' is within the bounds of the array\nbefore it is used as an index.\n\nFixes the below:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_discovery.c:1289 amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init() error: testing array offset 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' after use.",
