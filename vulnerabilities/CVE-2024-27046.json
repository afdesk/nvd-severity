  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfp: flower: handle acti_netdevs allocation failure\n\nThe kmalloc_array() in nfp_fl_lag_do_work() will return null, if\nthe physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference\nthe acti_netdevs, the null pointer dereference bugs will happen.\n\nThis patch adds a check to judge whether allocation failure occurs.\nIf it happens, the delayed work will be rescheduled and try again.",
