  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: fix phy_get_internal_delay accessing an empty array\n\nThe phy_get_internal_delay function could try to access to an empty\narray in the case that the driver is calling phy_get_internal_delay\nwithout defining delay_values and rx-internal-delay-ps or\ntx-internal-delay-ps is defined to 0 in the device-tree.\nThis will lead to \"unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at\nvirtual address 0\". To avoid this kernel oops, the test should be delay\n>= 0. As there is already delay < 0 test just before, the test could\nonly be size == 0.",
