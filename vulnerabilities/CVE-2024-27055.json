The function was incorrectly calling cpumask_test_cpu() with -1\nCPU leading to oopses like the following on some archs:\n\n  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff0002100296e0\n  ..\n  pc : wq_update_node_max_active+0x50/0x1fc\n  lr : wq_update_node_max_active+0x1f0/0x1fc\n  ...\n  Call trace:\n    wq_update_node_max_active+0x50/0x1fc\n    apply_wqattrs_commit+0xf0/0x114\n    apply_workqueue_attrs_locked+0x58/0xa0\n    alloc_workqueue+0x5ac/0x774\n    workqueue_init_early+0x460/0x540\n    start_kernel+0x258/0x684\n    __primary_switched+0xb8/0xc0\n  Code: 9100a273 35000d01 53067f00 d0016dc1 (f8607a60)\n  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idle task!\n  ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idle task! ]---\n\nFix it.",
