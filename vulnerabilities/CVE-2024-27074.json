  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: go7007: fix a memleak in go7007_load_encoder\n\nIn go7007_load_encoder, bounce(i.e. go->boot_fw), is allocated without\na deallocation thereafter. After the following call chain:\n\nsaa7134_go7007_init\n  |-> go7007_boot_encoder\n        |-> go7007_load_encoder\n  |-> kfree(go)\n\ngo is freed and thus bounce is leaked.",
