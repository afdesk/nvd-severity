  "Description": "IBM i 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability caused by an insufficient authority requirement. A local user without administrator privilege can configure a physical file trigger to execute with the privileges of a user socially engineered to access the target file. The correction is to require administrator privilege to configure trigger support.",
