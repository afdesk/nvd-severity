  "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 10.8.3, the exact Directus version number was being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer.",
