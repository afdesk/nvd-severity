  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npstore: inode: Only d_invalidate() is needed\n\nUnloading a modular pstore backend with records in pstorefs would\ntrigger the dput() double-drop warning:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2569 at fs/dcache.c:762 dput.part.0+0x3f3/0x410\n\nUsing the combo of d_drop()/dput() (as mentioned in\nDocumentation/filesystems/vfs.rst) isn't the right approach here, and\nleads to the reference counting problem seen above. Use d_invalidate()\nand update the code to not bother checking for error codes that can\nnever happen.\n\n---",
