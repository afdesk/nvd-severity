  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: mcast: remove one synchronize_net() barrier in ipv6_mc_down()\n\nAs discussed in the past (commit 2d3916f31891 (\"ipv6: fix skb drops\nin igmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()\")) I think the\nsynchronize_net() call in ipv6_mc_down() is not needed.\n\nUnder load, synchronize_net() can last between 200 usec and 5 ms.\n\nKASAN seems to agree as well.",
