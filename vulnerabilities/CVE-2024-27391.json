  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added\n\nCommit 09ed8bfc5215 (\"wilc1000: Rename workqueue from \"WILC_wq\" to\n\"NETDEV-wq\"\") moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to\nset the interface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver\nneeds only one workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we\nadd an interface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a\nnew one. This can be observed with the following commands:\n\nfor i in $(seq 0 10)\ndo\n  iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed\n  iw dev wlan1 del\ndone\nps -eo pid,comm|grep wlan\n\n 39 kworker/R-wlan0\n 98 kworker/R-wlan1\n102 kworker/R-wlan1\n105 kworker/R-wlan1\n108 kworker/R-wlan1\n111 kworker/R-wlan1\n114 kworker/R-wlan1\n117 kworker/R-wlan1\n120 kworker/R-wlan1\n123 kworker/R-wlan1\n126 kworker/R-wlan1\n129 kworker/R-wlan1\n\nFix this leakage by putting back hif_workqueue allocation in\nwilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding the workqueue name, it is indeed relevant to\nset it lowercase, however it is not  attached to a specific netdev, so\nenforcing netdev name in the name is not so relevant. Still, enrich the\nname with the wiphy name to make it clear which phy is using the workqueue.",
