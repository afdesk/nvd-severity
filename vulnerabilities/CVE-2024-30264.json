  "Description": "Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder. A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the sign-in page of typebot.io prior to version 2.24.0 may allow an attacker to hijack a user's account. The sign-in page takes the `redirectPath` parameter from the URL. If a user clicks on a link where the `redirectPath` parameter has a javascript scheme, the attacker that crafted the link may be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges  of the user. Version 2.24.0 contains a patch for this issue.",
