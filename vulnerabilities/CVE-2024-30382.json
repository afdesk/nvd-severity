  "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to send a specific routing update, causing an rpd core due to memory corruption, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThis issue can only be triggered when the system is configured for CoS-based forwarding (CBF) with a policy map containing a cos-next-hop-map action (see below).\nThis issue affects:\nJunos OS: \n\n\n  *  all versions before 20.4R3-S10, \n  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S8,\n  *  from 21.3 before 21.3R3, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3, \n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R2;\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO,\n  *  from 21.3 before 21.3R3-EVO, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-EVO, \n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R2-EVO.",
