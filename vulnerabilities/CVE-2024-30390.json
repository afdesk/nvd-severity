  "Description": "An Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a limited\u00a0Denial of Service (DoS) to the management plane.\n\nWhen an incoming connection was blocked because it exceeded the connections-per-second rate-limit, the system doesn't consider existing connections anymore for subsequent connection attempts so that the connection\u00a0limit can be exceeded.\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S4-EVO,\n  *  22.1-EVO versions before 22.1R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R3-S2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R2-S1-EVO, 22.3R3-EVO.",
