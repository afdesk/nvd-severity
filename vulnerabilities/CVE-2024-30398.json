  "Description": "An Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a high amount of specific traffic is received on a SRX4600 device, due to an error in internal packet handling, a consistent rise in CPU memory utilization occurs. This results in packet drops in the traffic and eventually the PFE crashes. A manual reboot of the PFE will be required to restore the device to original state.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n  *  21.2 before\u00a021.2R3-S7,\n  *  21.4 before 21.4R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  22.1 before 22.1R3-S5, \n  *  22.2 before 22.2R3-S3,\n  *  22.3 before 22.3R3-S2,\n  *  22.4 before 22.4R3,\n\n  *  23.2 before\u00a023.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.",
