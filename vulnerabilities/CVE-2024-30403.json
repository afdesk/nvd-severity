  "Description": "A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen Layer 2 traffic is sent through a logical interface, MAC learning happens. If during this process, the interface flaps,\u00a0an\u00a0Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt) core is observed. This leads to a PFE restart. The crash reoccurs if the same sequence of events happens, which will lead to a sustained DoS condition.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\u00a023.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.",
