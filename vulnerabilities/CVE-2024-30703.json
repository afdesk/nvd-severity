  "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been discovered in ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) Galactic Geochelone ROS_VERSION 2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION 3, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service (DoS), and obtain sensitive information via a crafted payload to the file upload mechanism of the ROS2 system, including the server\u2019s functionality for handling file uploads and the associated validation processes. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.",
