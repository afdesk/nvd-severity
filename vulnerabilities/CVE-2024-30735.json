  "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been discovered in ROS Kinetic Kame in ROS_VERSION 1 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION 3, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service (DoS), and obtain sensitive information via crafted payload to the file upload mechanism of the ROS system, including the server\u2019s functionality for handling file uploads and the associated validation processes. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability.",
