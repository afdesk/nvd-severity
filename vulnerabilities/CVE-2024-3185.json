  "Description": " A key used in logging.json does not follow the least privilege principle by default and is exposed to local users in the Rapid7 Platform.  This allows an attacker with local access to a machine with the logging.json file to use that key to authenticate to the platform with high privileges.  This was fixed in the Rapid7 platform starting 3 April 2024 via the introduction of a restricted role and the removal of automatic API key generation on installation of an agent.",
