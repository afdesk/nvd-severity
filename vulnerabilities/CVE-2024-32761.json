  "Description": "Under certain conditions, a data leak may occur in the Traffic Management Microkernels (TMMs) of BIG-IP tenants running on VELOS and rSeries platforms. This leak occurs randomly and cannot be deliberately triggered. If it occurs, it may leak up to 64 bytes of non-contiguous randomized bytes. Under rare conditions, this may lead to a TMM restart, affecting availability.\u00a0 Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated",
