  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau: fix stale locked mutex in nouveau_gem_ioctl_pushbuf\n\nIf VM_BIND is enabled on the client the legacy submission ioctl can't be\nused, however if a client tries to do so regardless it will return an\nerror. In this case the clients mutex remained unlocked leading to a\ndeadlock inside nouveau_drm_postclose or any other nouveau ioctl call.",
