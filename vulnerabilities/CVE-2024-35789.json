  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: check/clear fast rx for non-4addr sta VLAN changes\n\nWhen moving a station out of a VLAN and deleting the VLAN afterwards, the\nfast_rx entry still holds a pointer to the VLAN's netdev, which can cause\nuse-after-free bugs. Fix this by immediately calling ieee80211_check_fast_rx\nafter the VLAN change.",
