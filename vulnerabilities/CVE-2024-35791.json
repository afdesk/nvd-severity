  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: SVM: Flush pages under kvm->lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region()\n\nDo the cache flush of converted pages in svm_register_enc_region() before\ndropping kvm->lock to fix use-after-free issues where region and/or its\narray of pages could be freed by a different task, e.g. if userspace has\n__unregister_enc_region_locked() already queued up for the region.\n\nNote, the \"obvious\" alternative of using local variables doesn't fully\nresolve the bug, as region->pages is also dynamically allocated.  I.e. the\nregion structure itself would be fine, but region->pages could be freed.\n\nFlushing multiple pages under kvm->lock is unfortunate, but the entire\nflow is a rare slow path, and the manual flush is only needed on CPUs that\nlack coherency for encrypted memory.",
