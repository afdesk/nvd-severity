  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: cachestat: fix two shmem bugs\n\nWhen cachestat on shmem races with swapping and invalidation, there\nare two possible bugs:\n\n1) A swapin error can have resulted in a poisoned swap entry in the\n   shmem inode's xarray. Calling get_shadow_from_swap_cache() on it\n   will result in an out-of-bounds access to swapper_spaces[].\n\n   Validate the entry with non_swap_entry() before going further.\n\n2) When we find a valid swap entry in the shmem's inode, the shadow\n   entry in the swapcache might not exist yet: swap IO is still in\n   progress and we're before __remove_mapping; swapin, invalidation,\n   or swapoff have removed the shadow from swapcache after we saw the\n   shmem swap entry.\n\n   This will send a NULL to workingset_test_recent(). The latter\n   purely operates on pointer bits, so it won't crash - node 0, memcg\n   ID 0, eviction timestamp 0, etc. are all valid inputs - but it's a\n   bogus test. In theory that could result in a false \"recently\n   evicted\" count.\n\n   Such a false positive wouldn't be the end of the world. But for\n   code clarity and (future) robustness, be explicit about this case.\n\n   Bail on get_shadow_from_swap_cache() returning NULL.",
