  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdc-wdm: close race between read and workqueue\n\nwdm_read() cannot race with itself. However, in\nservice_outstanding_interrupt() it can race with the\nworkqueue, which can be triggered by error handling.\n\nHence we need to make sure that the WDM_RESPONDING\nflag is not just only set but tested.",
