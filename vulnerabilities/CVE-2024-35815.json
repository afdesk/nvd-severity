  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/aio: Check IOCB_AIO_RW before the struct aio_kiocb conversion\n\nThe first kiocb_set_cancel_fn() argument may point at a struct kiocb\nthat is not embedded inside struct aio_kiocb. With the current code,\ndepending on the compiler, the req->ki_ctx read happens either before\nthe IOCB_AIO_RW test or after that test. Move the req->ki_ctx read such\nthat it is guaranteed that the IOCB_AIO_RW test happens first.",
