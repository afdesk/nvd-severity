  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nubifs: Set page uptodate in the correct place\n\nPage cache reads are lockless, so setting the freshly allocated page\nuptodate before we've overwritten it with the data it's supposed to have\nin it will allow a simultaneous reader to see old data.  Move the call\nto SetPageUptodate into ubifs_write_end(), which is after we copied the\nnew data into the page.",
