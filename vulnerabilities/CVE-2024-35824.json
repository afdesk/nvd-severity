  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Fix regulators getting en-/dis-abled twice on suspend/resume\n\nWhen not configured for wakeup lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() will call\nlis3lv02d_poweroff() even if the device has already been turned off\nby the runtime-suspend handler and if configured for wakeup and\nthe device is runtime-suspended at this point then it is not turned\nback on to serve as a wakeup source.\n\nBefore commit b1b9f7a49440 (\"misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Add missing setting\nof the reg_ctrl callback\"), lis3lv02d_poweroff() failed to disable\nthe regulators which as a side effect made calling poweroff() twice ok.\n\nNow that poweroff() correctly disables the regulators, doing this twice\ntriggers a WARN() in the regulator core:\n\nunbalanced disables for regulator-dummy\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 92 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2999 _regulator_disable\n...\n\nFix lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() to not call poweroff() a second time if\nalready runtime-suspended and add a poweron() call when necessary to\nmake wakeup work.\n\nlis3lv02d_i2c_resume() has similar issues, with an added weirness that\nit always powers on the device if it is runtime suspended, after which\nthe first runtime-resume will call poweron() again, causing the enabled\ncount for the regulator to increase by 1 every suspend/resume. These\nunbalanced regulator_enable() calls cause the regulator to never\nbe turned off and trigger the following WARN() on driver unbind:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1724 at drivers/regulator/core.c:2396 _regulator_put\n\nFix this by making lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() mirror the new suspend().",
