  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: fix a double-free in arfs_create_groups\n\nWhen `in` allocated by kvzalloc fails, arfs_create_groups will free\nft->g and return an error. However, arfs_create_table, the only caller of\narfs_create_groups, will hold this error and call to\nmlx5e_destroy_flow_table, in which the ft->g will be freed again.",
