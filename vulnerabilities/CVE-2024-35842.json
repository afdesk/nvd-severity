  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: mediatek: sof-common: Add NULL check for normal_link string\n\nIt's not granted that all entries of struct sof_conn_stream declare\na `normal_link` (a non-SOF, direct link) string, and this is the case\nfor SoCs that support only SOF paths (hence do not support both direct\nand SOF usecases).\n\nFor example, in the case of MT8188 there is no normal_link string in\nany of the sof_conn_stream entries and there will be more drivers\ndoing that in the future.\n\nTo avoid possible NULL pointer KPs, add a NULL check for `normal_link`.",
