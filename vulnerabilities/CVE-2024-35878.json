  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nof: module: prevent NULL pointer dereference in vsnprintf()\n\nIn of_modalias(), we can get passed the str and len parameters which would\ncause a kernel oops in vsnprintf() since it only allows passing a NULL ptr\nwhen the length is also 0. Also, we need to filter out the negative values\nof the len parameter as these will result in a really huge buffer since\nsnprintf() takes size_t parameter while ours is ssize_t...\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace static\nanalysis tool.",
