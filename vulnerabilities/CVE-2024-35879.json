  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nof: dynamic: Synchronize of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removals\n\nIn the following sequence:\n  1) of_platform_depopulate()\n  2) of_overlay_remove()\n\nDuring the step 1, devices are destroyed and devlinks are removed.\nDuring the step 2, OF nodes are destroyed but\n__of_changeset_entry_destroy() can raise warnings related to missing\nof_node_put():\n  ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2 ...\n\nIndeed, during the devlink removals performed at step 1, the removal\nitself releasing the device (and the attached of_node) is done by a job\nqueued in a workqueue and so, it is done asynchronously with respect to\nfunction calls.\nWhen the warning is present, of_node_put() will be called but wrongly\ntoo late from the workqueue job.\n\nIn order to be sure that any ongoing devlink removals are done before\nthe of_node destruction, synchronize the of_changeset_destroy() with the\ndevlink removals.",
