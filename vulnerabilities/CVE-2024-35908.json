  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak\n\nAt the start of tls_sw_recvmsg, we take a reference on the psock, and\nthen call tls_rx_reader_lock. If that fails, we return directly\nwithout releasing the reference.\n\nInstead of adding a new label, just take the reference after locking\nhas succeeded, since we don't need it before.",
