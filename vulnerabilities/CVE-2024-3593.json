  "Description": "The UberMenu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ubermenu_delete_all_item_settings and ubermenu_reset_settings functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete and reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
