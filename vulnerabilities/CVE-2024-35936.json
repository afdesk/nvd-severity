  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: handle chunk tree lookup error in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks()\n\nThe unhandled case in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption,\nas it could be caused only by two impossible conditions:\n\n- at first the search key is set up to look for a chunk tree item, with\n  offset -1, this is an inexact search and the key->offset will contain\n  the correct offset upon a successful search, a valid chunk tree item\n  cannot have an offset -1\n\n- after first successful search, the found_key corresponds to a chunk\n  item, the offset is decremented by 1 before the next loop, it's\n  impossible to find a chunk item there due to alignment and size\n  constraints",
