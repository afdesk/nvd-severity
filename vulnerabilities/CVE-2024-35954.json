  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: sg: Avoid sg device teardown race\n\nsg_remove_sfp_usercontext() must not use sg_device_destroy() after calling\nscsi_device_put().\n\nsg_device_destroy() is accessing the parent scsi_device request_queue which\nwill already be set to NULL when the preceding call to scsi_device_put()\nremoved the last reference to the parent scsi_device.\n\nThe resulting NULL pointer exception will then crash the kernel.",
