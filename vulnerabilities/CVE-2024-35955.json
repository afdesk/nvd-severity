  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkprobes: Fix possible use-after-free issue on kprobe registration\n\nWhen unloading a module, its state is changing MODULE_STATE_LIVE ->\n MODULE_STATE_GOING -> MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. Each change will take\na time. `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`\nworks with MODULE_STATE_LIVE and MODULE_STATE_GOING.\nIf we use `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`\nseparately, there is a chance that the first one is succeeded but the\nnext one is failed because module->state becomes MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED\nbetween those operations.\n\nIn `check_kprobe_address_safe()`, if the second `__module_text_address()`\nis failed, that is ignored because it expected a kernel_text address.\nBut it may have failed simply because module->state has been changed\nto MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. In this case, arm_kprobe() will try to modify\nnon-exist module text address (use-after-free).\n\nTo fix this problem, we should not use separated `is_module_text_address()`\nand `__module_text_address()`, but use only `__module_text_address()`\nonce and do `try_module_get(module)` which is only available with\nMODULE_STATE_LIVE.",
