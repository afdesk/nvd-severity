  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validation\n\nEach attribute inside a nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST is assumed to be a\nstruct ifla_vf_vlan_info so the size of such attribute needs to be at least\nof sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes.\nThe current size validation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes)\nwhich is less than sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) so this validation\nis not enough and a too small attribute might be cast to a\nstruct ifla_vf_vlan_info, this might result in an out of bands\nread access when accessing the saved (casted) entry in ivvl.",
