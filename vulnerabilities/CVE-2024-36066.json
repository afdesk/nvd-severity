  "Description": "The CMP CLI client in KeyFactor EJBCA before 8.3.1 has only 6 octets of salt, and is thus not compliant with the security requirements of RFC 4211, and might make man-in-the-middle attacks easier. CMP includes password-based MAC as one of the options for message integrity and authentication (the other option is certificate-based). RFC 4211 section 4.4 requires that password-based MAC parameters use a salt with a random value of at least 8 octets. This helps to inhibit dictionary attacks. Because the standalone CMP client originally was developed as test code, the salt was instead hardcoded and only 6 octets long.",
