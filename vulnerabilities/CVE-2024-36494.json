  "Description": "Due to missing input sanitization, an attacker can perform cross-site-scripting attacks and run arbitrary Javascript in the browser of other users. The login page at /cgi/slogin.cgi suffers from XSS due to improper input filtering of the -tsetup+-uuser parameter, which can only be exploited if the target user is not already logged in. This makes it ideal for login form phishing attempts.",
