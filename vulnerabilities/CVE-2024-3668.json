  "Description": "The PowerPack Pro for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.17. This is due to the plugin not restricting low privileged users from setting a default role for a registration form. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration form with administrator set as the default role and then register as an administrator.",
