  "Description": "The Ultimate 410 Gone Status Code plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 410 entries in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.  Please note TinyWeb as a separate Web Browser is not affected, and only shares a name with the author of this plugin.",
