  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointers\n\nCurrently, if an automatically freed allocation is an error pointer that\nwill lead to a crash.  An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show().\n\n   171\tchar *label __free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i);\n   172\tif (IS_ERR(label)) {\n   173\t\tdev_err(wm831x->dev, \"Failed to duplicate label\\n\");\n   174\t\tcontinue;\n   175  }\n\nThe auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well,\notherwise we're going to keep hitting issues like this.",
