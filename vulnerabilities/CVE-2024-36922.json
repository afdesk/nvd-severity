  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: read txq->read_ptr under lock\n\nIf we read txq->read_ptr without lock, we can read the same\nvalue twice, then obtain the lock, and reclaim from there\nto two different places, but crucially reclaim the same\nentry twice, resulting in the WARN_ONCE() a little later.\nFix that by reading txq->read_ptr under lock.",
