  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Release hbalock before calling lpfc_worker_wake_up()\n\nlpfc_worker_wake_up() calls the lpfc_work_done() routine, which takes the\nhbalock.  Thus, lpfc_worker_wake_up() should not be called while holding the\nhbalock to avoid potential deadlock.",
