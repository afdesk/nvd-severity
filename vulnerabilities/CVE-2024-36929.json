  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: core: reject skb_copy(_expand) for fraglist GSO skbs\n\nSKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs must not be linearized, otherwise they become\ninvalid. Return NULL if such an skb is passed to skb_copy or\nskb_copy_expand, in order to prevent a crash on a potential later\ncall to skb_gso_segment.",
