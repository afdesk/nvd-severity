  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/proc/task_mmu: fix loss of young/dirty bits during pagemap scan\n\nmake_uffd_wp_pte() was previously doing:\n\n  pte = ptep_get(ptep);\n  ptep_modify_prot_start(ptep);\n  pte = pte_mkuffd_wp(pte);\n  ptep_modify_prot_commit(ptep, pte);\n\nBut if another thread accessed or dirtied the pte between the first 2\ncalls, this could lead to loss of that information.  Since\nptep_modify_prot_start() gets and clears atomically, the following is the\ncorrect pattern and prevents any possible race.  Any access after the\nfirst call would see an invalid pte and cause a fault:\n\n  pte = ptep_modify_prot_start(ptep);\n  pte = pte_mkuffd_wp(pte);\n  ptep_modify_prot_commit(ptep, pte);",
