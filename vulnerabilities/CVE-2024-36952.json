  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up\n\nThere are cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believes\nthe NPIV is logged into the fabric.  This occurs when a vport is\nunregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the\nfabric.\n\nCurrently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including\nthe fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport\nobject.  This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID and\nLOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.\n\nFix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID\nand LOGO are sent.",
