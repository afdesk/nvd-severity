  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: arm64: vgic-v2: Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr()\n\nvgic_v2_parse_attr() is responsible for finding the vCPU that matches\nthe user-provided CPUID, which (of course) may not be valid. If the ID\nis invalid, kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() returns NULL, which isn't handled\ngracefully.\n\nSimilar to the GICv3 uaccess flow, check that kvm_get_vcpu_by_id()\nactually returns something and fail the ioctl if not.",
