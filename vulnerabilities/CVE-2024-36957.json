  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteontx2-af: avoid off-by-one read from userspace\n\nWe try to access count + 1 byte from userspace with memdup_user(buffer,\ncount + 1). However, the userspace only provides buffer of count bytes and\nonly these count bytes are verified to be okay to access. To ensure the\ncopied buffer is NUL terminated, we use memdup_user_nul instead.",
