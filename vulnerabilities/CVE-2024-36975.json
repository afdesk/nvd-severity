  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKEYS: trusted: Do not use WARN when encode fails\n\nWhen asn1_encode_sequence() fails, WARN is not the correct solution.\n\n1. asn1_encode_sequence() is not an internal function (located\n   in lib/asn1_encode.c).\n2. Location is known, which makes the stack trace useless.\n3. Results a crash if panic_on_warn is set.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the use of WARN is undocumented, and it\nshould be avoided unless there is a carefully considered rationale to\nuse it.\n\nReplace WARN with pr_err, and print the return value instead, which is\nonly useful piece of information.",
