  "Description": "Insecure handling of POST header parameter body\u00a0included in requests being sent to an instance of the open-source project\u00a0Phoniebox allows an attacker to create a website, which \u2013 when visited by a user \u2013 will send\u00a0malicious requests to multiple hosts on the local network. If such a request reaches the server, it will cause a\u00a0shell command execution.\n\n\nThis issue affects Phoniebox in all releases through 2.7. Newer releases were not tested, but they might also be vulnerable.",
