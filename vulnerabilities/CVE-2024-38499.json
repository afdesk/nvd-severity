  "Description": "CA Client Automation (ITCM) allows non-admin/non-root users to encrypt a string using CAF CLI and SD_ACMD CLI. This would allow the non admin user to access the critical encryption keys which further causes the exploitation of stored credentials. This fix doesn't allow a non-admin/non-root user to execute \"caf encrypt\"/\"sd_acmd encrypt\" commands.",
