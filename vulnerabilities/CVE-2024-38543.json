  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib/test_hmm.c: handle src_pfns and dst_pfns allocation failure\n\nThe kcalloc() in dmirror_device_evict_chunk() will return null if the\nphysical memory has run out.  As a result, if src_pfns or dst_pfns is\ndereferenced, the null pointer dereference bug will happen.\n\nMoreover, the device is going away.  If the kcalloc() fails, the pages\nmapping a chunk could not be evicted.  So add a __GFP_NOFAIL flag in\nkcalloc().\n\nFinally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory, Switch\nkcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid failing allocations.",
