  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pkt\n\nIn rxe_comp_queue_pkt() an incoming response packet skb is enqueued to the\nresp_pkts queue and then a decision is made whether to run the completer\ntask inline or schedule it. Finally the skb is dereferenced to bump a 'hw'\nperformance counter. This is wrong because if the completer task is\nalready running in a separate thread it may have already processed the skb\nand freed it which can cause a seg fault.  This has been observed\ninfrequently in testing at high scale.\n\nThis patch fixes this by changing the order of enqueuing the packet until\nafter the counter is accessed.",
