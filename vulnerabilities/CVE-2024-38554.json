  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nax25: Fix reference count leak issue of net_device\n\nThere is a reference count leak issue of the object \"net_device\" in\nax25_dev_device_down(). When the ax25 device is shutting down, the\nax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device one\nor zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will\ncause memory leak.\n\nIn order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count of\nnet_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.",
