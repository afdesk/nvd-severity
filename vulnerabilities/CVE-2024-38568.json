  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers/perf: hisi: hns3: Fix out-of-bound access when valid event group\n\nThe perf tool allows users to create event groups through following\ncmd [1], but the driver does not check whether the array index is out\nof bounds when writing data to the event_group array. If the number of\nevents in an event_group is greater than HNS3_PMU_MAX_HW_EVENTS, the\nmemory write overflow of event_group array occurs.\n\nAdd array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation,\nand return directly when write new events are written to array bounds.\n\nThere are 9 different events in an event_group.\n[1] perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}",
