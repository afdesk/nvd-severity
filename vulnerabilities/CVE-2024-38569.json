  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers/perf: hisi_pcie: Fix out-of-bound access when valid event group\n\nThe perf tool allows users to create event groups through following\ncmd [1], but the driver does not check whether the array index is out of\nbounds when writing data to the event_group array. If the number of events\nin an event_group is greater than HISI_PCIE_MAX_COUNTERS, the memory write\noverflow of event_group array occurs.\n\nAdd array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation,\nand return directly when write new events are written to array bounds.\n\nThere are 9 different events in an event_group.\n[1] perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}'",
