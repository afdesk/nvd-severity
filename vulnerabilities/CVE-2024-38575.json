  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: pcie: handle randbuf allocation failure\n\nThe kzalloc() in brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram() will return null\nif the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we use\nget_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, the\nnull pointer dereference bug will happen.\n\nIn order to prevent allocation failure, this patch adds a separate\nfunction using buffer on kernel stack to generate random bytes in\nthe randbuf, which could prevent the kernel stack from overflow.",
