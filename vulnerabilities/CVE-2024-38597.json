  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\neth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks\n\nErhard reports netpoll warnings from sungem:\n\n  netpoll_send_skb_on_dev(): eth0 enabled interrupts in poll (gem_start_xmit+0x0/0x398)\n  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at net/core/netpoll.c:370 netpoll_send_skb+0x1fc/0x20c\n\ngem_poll_controller() disables interrupts, which may sleep.\nWe can't sleep in netpoll, it has interrupts disabled completely.\nStrangely, gem_poll_controller() doesn't even poll the completions,\nand instead acts as if an interrupt has fired so it just schedules\nNAPI and exits. None of this has been necessary for years, since\nnetpoll invokes NAPI directly.",
