  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers/perf: hisi: hns3: Actually use devm_add_action_or_reset()\n\npci_alloc_irq_vectors() allocates an irq vector. When devm_add_action()\nfails, the irq vector is not freed, which leads to a memory leak.\n\nReplace the devm_add_action with devm_add_action_or_reset to ensure\nthe irq vector can be destroyed when it fails.",
