  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: carl9170: re-fix fortified-memset warning\n\nThe carl9170_tx_release() function sometimes triggers a fortified-memset\nwarning in my randconfig builds:\n\nIn file included from include/linux/string.h:254,\n                 from drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:40:\nIn function 'fortify_memset_chk',\n    inlined from 'carl9170_tx_release' at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:283:2,\n    inlined from 'kref_put' at include/linux/kref.h:65:3,\n    inlined from 'carl9170_tx_put_skb' at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:342:9:\ninclude/linux/fortify-string.h:493:25: error: call to '__write_overflow_field' declared with attribute warning: detected write beyond size of field (1st parameter); maybe use struct_group()? [-Werror=attribute-warning]\n  493 |                         __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size);\n\nKees previously tried to avoid this by using memset_after(), but it seems\nthis does not fully address the problem. I noticed that the memset_after()\nhere is done on a different part of the union (status) than the original\ncast was from (rate_driver_data), which may confuse the compiler.\n\nUnfortunately, the memset_after() trick does not work on driver_rates[]\nbecause that is part of an anonymous struct, and I could not get\nstruct_group() to do this either. Using two separate memset() calls\non the two members does address the warning though.",
