  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: max3100: Update uart_driver_registered on driver removal\n\nThe removal of the last MAX3100 device triggers the removal of\nthe driver. However, code doesn't update the respective global\nvariable and after insmod \u2014 rmmod \u2014 insmod cycle the kernel\noopses:\n\n  max3100 spi-PRP0001:01: max3100_probe: adding port 0\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000408\n  ...\n  RIP: 0010:serial_core_register_port+0xa0/0x840\n  ...\n   max3100_probe+0x1b6/0x280 [max3100]\n   spi_probe+0x8d/0xb0\n\nUpdate the actual state so next time UART driver will be registered\nagain.\n\nHugo also noticed, that the error path in the probe also affected\nby having the variable set, and not cleared. Instead of clearing it\nmove the assignment after the successfull uart_register_driver() call.",
