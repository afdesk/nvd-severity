  "Description": "The Delta Electronics DVW-W02W2-E2 devices expose a web administration interface to users. This interface implements two features\u00a0(access control lists management, WPS pin setup) that are affected by command injections and stack overflows vulnerabilities.\nSuccessful exploitation of these flaws would allow remote authenticated attackers to gain remote command execution with\u00a0elevated privileges on the affected devices.\n\nThis issue affects DVW-W02W2-E2 through version 2.5.2.\n\n",
