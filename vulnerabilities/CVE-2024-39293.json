  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"xsk: Support redirect to any socket bound to the same umem\"\n\nThis reverts commit 2863d665ea41282379f108e4da6c8a2366ba66db.\n\nThis patch introduced a potential kernel crash when multiple napi instances\nredirect to the same AF_XDP socket. By removing the queue_index check, it is\npossible for multiple napi instances to access the Rx ring at the same time,\nwhich will result in a corrupted ring state which can lead to a crash when\nflushing the rings in __xsk_flush(). This can happen when the linked list of\nsockets to flush gets corrupted by concurrent accesses. A quick and small fix\nis not possible, so let us revert this for now.",
