  "Description": "The Basil recipe theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `post_title` parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a compromised page. Because the of the default WordPress validation, it is not possible to insert the payload directly but if the Cooked plugin is installed, it is possible to create a recipe post type (cp_recipe) and inject the payload in the title field. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch for the issue.",
