  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mc: Fix graph walk in media_pipeline_start\n\nThe graph walk tries to follow all links, even if they are not between\npads. This causes a crash with, e.g. a MEDIA_LNK_FL_ANCILLARY_LINK link.\n\nFix this by allowing the walk to proceed only for MEDIA_LNK_FL_DATA_LINK\nlinks.",
