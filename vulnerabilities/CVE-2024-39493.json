  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: qat - Fix ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC memory leak\n\nUsing completion_done to determine whether the caller has gone\naway only works after a complete call.  Furthermore it's still\npossible that the caller has not yet called wait_for_completion,\nresulting in another potential UAF.\n\nFix this by making the caller use cancel_work_sync and then freeing\nthe memory safely.",
