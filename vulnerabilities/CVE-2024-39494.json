  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: Fix use-after-free on a dentry's dname.name\n\n->d_name.name can change on rename and the earlier value can be freed;\nthere are conditions sufficient to stabilize it (->d_lock on dentry,\n->d_lock on its parent, ->i_rwsem exclusive on the parent's inode,\nrename_lock), but none of those are met at any of the sites. Take a stable\nsnapshot of the name instead.",
