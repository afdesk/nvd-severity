  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngreybus: Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to race condition.\n\nIn gb_interface_create, &intf->mode_switch_completion is bound with\ngb_interface_mode_switch_work. Then it will be started by\ngb_interface_request_mode_switch. Here is the relevant code.\nif (!queue_work(system_long_wq, &intf->mode_switch_work)) {\n\t...\n}\n\nIf we call gb_interface_release to make cleanup, there may be an\nunfinished work. This function will call kfree to free the object\n\"intf\". However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled to\nrun after kfree, it may cause use-after-free error as\ngb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object \"intf\".\nThe possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows:\n\nCPU0                            CPU1\n\n                            |   gb_interface_create\n                            |   gb_interface_request_mode_switch\ngb_interface_release        |\nkfree(intf) (free)          |\n                            |   gb_interface_mode_switch_work\n                            |   mutex_lock(&intf->mutex) (use)\n\nFix it by canceling the work before kfree.",
