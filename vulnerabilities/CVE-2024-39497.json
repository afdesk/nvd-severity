  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/shmem-helper: Fix BUG_ON() on mmap(PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE)\n\nLack of check for copy-on-write (COW) mapping in drm_gem_shmem_mmap\nallows users to call mmap with PROT_WRITE and MAP_PRIVATE flag\ncausing a kernel panic due to BUG_ON in vmf_insert_pfn_prot:\nBUG_ON((vma->vm_flags & VM_PFNMAP) && is_cow_mapping(vma->vm_flags));\n\nReturn -EINVAL early if COW mapping is detected.\n\nThis bug affects all drm drivers using default shmem helpers.\nIt can be reproduced by this simple example:\nvoid *ptr = mmap(0, size, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, mmap_offset);\nptr[0] = 0;",
