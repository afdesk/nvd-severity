  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nliquidio: Adjust a NULL pointer handling path in lio_vf_rep_copy_packet\n\nIn lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() pg_info->page is compared to a NULL value,\nbut then it is unconditionally passed to skb_add_rx_frag() which looks\nstrange and could lead to null pointer dereference.\n\nlio_vf_rep_copy_packet() call trace looks like:\n\tocteon_droq_process_packets\n\t octeon_droq_fast_process_packets\n\t  octeon_droq_dispatch_pkt\n\t   octeon_create_recv_info\n\t    ...search in the dispatch_list...\n\t     ->disp_fn(rdisp->rinfo, ...)\n\t      lio_vf_rep_pkt_recv(struct octeon_recv_info *recv_info, ...)\nIn this path there is no code which sets pg_info->page to NULL.\nSo this check looks unneeded and doesn't solve potential problem.\nBut I guess the author had reason to add a check and I have no such card\nand can't do real test.\nIn addition, the code in the function liquidio_push_packet() in\nliquidio/lio_core.c does exactly the same.\n\nBased on this, I consider the most acceptable compromise solution to\nadjust this issue by moving skb_add_rx_frag() into conditional scope.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
