  "Description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a specific \"clear\" command is run, the\u00a0Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt or evo-aftmand-zx) crashes and restarts.\n\nThe crash\u00a0impacts all traffic going through the FPCs, causing a DoS. Running the command repeatedly leads to a sustained DoS condition.\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S9-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.2-EVO before 21.2R3-S7-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.3-EVO before 21.3R3-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S6-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S4-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.",
