  "Description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the\u00a0Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nIn an EVPN/VXLAN scenario, when a high amount specific Layer 2 packets are processed by the device, it can cause the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) to utilize all CPU resources which causes the device to hang. A manual restart of the rpd is required to restore services.\n\nThis issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.\nThis issue affects\nJunos OS:\nAll versions earlier than\u00a021.4R3-S7;\n22.1\u00a0versions earlier than 22.1R3-S5;\n22.2 versions earlier than\u00a022.2R3-S3;\n22.3 versions earlier than\u00a022.3R3-S3;\n22.4 versions earlier than\u00a022.4R3-S2;\n23.2 versions earlier than\u00a023.2R2;\n23.4 versions earlier than\u00a023.4R1-S1.\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\nAll versions earlier than\u00a021.4R3-S7-EVO;\n22.1-EVO versions earlier than\u00a022.1R3-S5-EVO;\n22.2-EVO versions earlier than\u00a022.2R3-S3-EVO;\n22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R3-S3-EVO;\n22.4-EVO versions earlier than\u00a022.4R3-S2-EVO;\n23.2-EVO versions earlier than\u00a023.2R2-EVO;\n23.4-EVO versions earlier than\u00a023.4R1-S1-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.",
