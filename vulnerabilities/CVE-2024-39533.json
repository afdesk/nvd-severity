  "Description": "An Unimplemented or Unsupported Feature in the UI vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a minor integrity impact to downstream networks.If one or more of the following match conditions\n\nip-source-address\nip-destination-address\narp-type\n\nwhich are not supported for this type of filter, are used in an ethernet switching filter,\u00a0and then this filter is applied as an output filter, the configuration can be committed but the filter will not be in effect.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series:\n\n  *  All version before 21.2R3-S7,\u00a0\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S6,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S5,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3,\n  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S2,\u00a0\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2.\n\n\n\nPlease note that the implemented fix ensures these unsupported match conditions cannot be committed anymore.",
