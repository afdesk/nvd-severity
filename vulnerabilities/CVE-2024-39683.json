  "Description": "ZITADEL is an open-source identity infrastructure tool. ZITADEL provides users the ability to list all user sessions of the current user agent (browser). Starting in version 2.53.0 and prior to versions 2.53.8, 2.54.5, and 2.55.1, due to a missing check, user sessions without that information (e.g. when created though the session service) were incorrectly listed exposing potentially other user's sessions. Versions 2.55.1, 2.54.5, and 2.53.8 contain a fix for the issue. There is no workaround since a patch is already available.",
