This affected the is_private and is_global properties of the ipaddress.IPv4Address, ipaddress.IPv4Network, ipaddress.IPv6Address, and ipaddress.IPv6Network classes, where values wouldn\u2019t be returned in accordance with the latest information from the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries.\n\nCPython 3.12.4 and 3.13.0a6 contain updated information from these registries and thus have the intended behavior.",
