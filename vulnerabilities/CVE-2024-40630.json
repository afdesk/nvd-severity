  "Description": "OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files of any image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API with a feature set, scalability, and robustness needed for feature film production. In affected versions there is a bug in the heif input functionality of OpenImageIO. Specifically, in `HeifInput::seek_subimage()`.  In the worst case, this can lead to an information disclosure vulnerability, particularly for programs that directly use the `ImageInput` APIs. This bug has been addressed in commit `0a2dcb4c` which is included in the 2.5.13.1 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
