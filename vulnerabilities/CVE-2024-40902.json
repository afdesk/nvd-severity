  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: xattr: fix buffer overflow for invalid xattr\n\nWhen an xattr size is not what is expected, it is printed out to the\nkernel log in hex format as a form of debugging.  But when that xattr\nsize is bigger than the expected size, printing it out can cause an\naccess off the end of the buffer.\n\nFix this all up by properly restricting the size of the debug hex dump\nin the kernel log.",
