  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix a potential use-after-free in bpf_link_free()\n\nAfter commit 1a80dbcb2dba, bpf_link can be freed by\nlink->ops->dealloc_deferred, but the code still tests and uses\nlink->ops->dealloc afterward, which leads to a use-after-free as\nreported by syzbot. Actually, one of them should be sufficient, so\njust call one of them instead of both. Also add a WARN_ON() in case\nof any problematic implementation.",
