  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send()\n\nIn case of token is released due to token->state == BNXT_HWRM_DEFERRED,\nreleased token (set to NULL) is used in log messages. This issue is\nexpected to be prevented by HWRM_ERR_CODE_PF_UNAVAILABLE error code. But\nthis error code is returned by recent firmware. So some firmware may not\nreturn it. This may lead to NULL pointer dereference.\nAdjust this issue by adding token pointer check.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
