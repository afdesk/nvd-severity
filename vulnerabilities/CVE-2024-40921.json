  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: bridge: mst: pass vlan group directly to br_mst_vlan_set_state\n\nPass the already obtained vlan group pointer to br_mst_vlan_set_state()\ninstead of dereferencing it again. Each caller has already correctly\ndereferenced it for their context. This change is required for the\nfollowing suspicious RCU dereference fix. No functional changes\nintended.",
