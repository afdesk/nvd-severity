  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngve: Clear napi->skb before dev_kfree_skb_any()\n\ngve_rx_free_skb incorrectly leaves napi->skb referencing an skb after it\nis freed with dev_kfree_skb_any(). This can result in a subsequent call\nto napi_get_frags returning a dangling pointer.\n\nFix this by clearing napi->skb before the skb is freed.",
