  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: lpi2c: Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer\n\nInstead of repeatedly calling clk_get_rate for each transfer, lock\nthe clock rate and cache the value.\nA deadlock has been observed while adding tlv320aic32x4 audio codec to\nthe system. When this clock provider adds its clock, the clk mutex is\nlocked already, it needs to access i2c, which in return needs the mutex\nfor clk_get_rate as well.",
