  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nMIPS: Octeon: Add PCIe link status check\n\nThe standard PCIe configuration read-write interface is used to\naccess the configuration space of the peripheral PCIe devices\nof the mips processor after the PCIe link surprise down, it can\ngenerate kernel panic caused by \"Data bus error\". So it is\nnecessary to add PCIe link status check for system protection.\nWhen the PCIe link is down or in training, assigning a value\nof 0 to the configuration address can prevent read-write behavior\nto the configuration space of peripheral PCIe devices, thereby\npreventing kernel panic.",
