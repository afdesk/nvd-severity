  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/tcp_ao: Don't leak ao_info on error-path\n\nIt seems I introduced it together with TCP_AO_CMDF_AO_REQUIRED, on\nversion 5 [1] of TCP-AO patches. Quite frustrative that having all these\nselftests that I've written, running kmemtest & kcov was always in todo.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20230215183335.800122-5-dima@arista.com/",
