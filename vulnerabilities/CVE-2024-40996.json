  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Avoid splat in pskb_pull_reason\n\nsyzkaller builds (CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=y) frequently trigger a debug\nhint in pskb_may_pull.\n\nWe'd like to retain this debug check because it might hint at integer\noverflows and other issues (kernel code should pull headers, not huge\nvalue).\n\nIn bpf case, this splat isn't interesting at all: such (nonsensical)\nbpf programs are typically generated by a fuzzer anyway.\n\nDo what Eric suggested and suppress such warning.\n\nFor CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=n we don't need the extra check because\npskb_may_pull will do the right thing: return an error without the\nWARN() backtrace.",
