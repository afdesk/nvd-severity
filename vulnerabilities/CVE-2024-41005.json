  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetpoll: Fix race condition in netpoll_owner_active\n\nKCSAN detected a race condition in netpoll:\n\n\tBUG: KCSAN: data-race in net_rx_action / netpoll_send_skb\n\twrite (marked) to 0xffff8881164168b0 of 4 bytes by interrupt on cpu 10:\n\tnet_rx_action (./include/linux/netpoll.h:90 net/core/dev.c:6712 net/core/dev.c:6822)\n<snip>\n\tread to 0xffff8881164168b0 of 4 bytes by task 1 on cpu 2:\n\tnetpoll_send_skb (net/core/netpoll.c:319 net/core/netpoll.c:345 net/core/netpoll.c:393)\n\tnetpoll_send_udp (net/core/netpoll.c:?)\n<snip>\n\tvalue changed: 0x0000000a -> 0xffffffff\n\nThis happens because netpoll_owner_active() needs to check if the\ncurrent CPU is the owner of the lock, touching napi->poll_owner\nnon atomically. The ->poll_owner field contains the current CPU holding\nthe lock.\n\nUse an atomic read to check if the poll owner is the current CPU.",
