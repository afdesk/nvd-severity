  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask\n\nThe problem is that there are systems where cpu_possible_mask has gaps\nbetween set CPUs, for example SPARC.  In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa()\nhash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not\nsetup CPU area using per_cpu() macro.  This results in an oops on SPARC.\n\nA per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly\nassuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps.  Fix it by adjusting an index\nto a next possible CPU.",
