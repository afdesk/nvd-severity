  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix null deref on system suspend entry\n\nWhen system enters suspend with an active stream, SOF core\ncalls hw_params_upon_resume(). On Intel platforms with HDA DMA used\nto manage the link DMA, this leads to call chain of\n\n   hda_dsp_set_hw_params_upon_resume()\n -> hda_dsp_dais_suspend()\n -> hda_dai_suspend()\n -> hda_ipc4_post_trigger()\n\nA bug is hit in hda_dai_suspend() as hda_link_dma_cleanup() is run first,\nwhich clears hext_stream->link_substream, and then hda_ipc4_post_trigger()\nis called with a NULL snd_pcm_substream pointer.",
