  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nppp: reject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed packets\n\nSince 'ppp_async_encode()' assumes valid LCP packets (with code\nfrom 1 to 7 inclusive), add 'ppp_check_packet()' to ensure that\nLCP packet has an actual body beyond PPP_LCP header bytes, and\nreject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed data otherwise.",
