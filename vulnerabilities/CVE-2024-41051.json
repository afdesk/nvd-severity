  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachefiles: wait for ondemand_object_worker to finish when dropping object\n\nWhen queuing ondemand_object_worker() to re-open the object,\ncachefiles_object is not pinned. The cachefiles_object may be freed when\nthe pending read request is completed intentionally and the related\nerofs is umounted. If ondemand_object_worker() runs after the object is\nfreed, it will incur use-after-free problem as shown below.\n\nprocess A  processs B  process C  process D\n\ncachefiles_ondemand_send_req()\n// send a read req X\n// wait for its completion\n\n           // close ondemand fd\n           cachefiles_ondemand_fd_release()\n           // set object as CLOSE\n\n                       cachefiles_ondemand_daemon_read()\n                       // set object as REOPENING\n                       queue_work(fscache_wq, &info->ondemand_work)\n\n                                // close /dev/cachefiles\n                                cachefiles_daemon_release\n                                cachefiles_flush_reqs\n                                complete(&req->done)\n\n// read req X is completed\n// umount the erofs fs\ncachefiles_put_object()\n// object will be freed\ncachefiles_ondemand_deinit_obj_info()\nkmem_cache_free(object)\n                       // both info and object are freed\n                       ondemand_object_worker()\n\nWhen dropping an object, it is no longer necessary to reopen the object,\nso use cancel_work_sync() to cancel or wait for ondemand_object_worker()\nto finish.",
