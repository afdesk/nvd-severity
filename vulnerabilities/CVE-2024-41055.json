  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: prevent derefencing NULL ptr in pfn_section_valid()\n\nCommit 5ec8e8ea8b77 (\"mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing\nmemory_section->usage\") changed pfn_section_valid() to add a READ_ONCE()\ncall around \"ms->usage\" to fix a race with section_deactivate() where\nms->usage can be cleared.  The READ_ONCE() call, by itself, is not enough\nto prevent NULL pointer dereference.  We need to check its value before\ndereferencing it.",
