  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntun: add missing verification for short frame\n\nThe cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length\nin the tun_xdp_one() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be sent\ndownstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, the\ntun_xdp_one-->eth_type_trans() may access the Ethernet header although it\ncan be less than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause\nout-of-bound access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer\nwith incorrect or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.\n\nIn the alternative path, tun_get_user() already prohibits short frame which\nhas the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted for\nIFF_TAP.\n\nThis is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like\nhow tun_get_user() does.\n\nCVE: CVE-2024-41091",
