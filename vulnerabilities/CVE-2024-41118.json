  "Description": "streamlit-geospatial is a streamlit multipage app for geospatial applications. Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `url` variable on line 47 of `pages/7_?_Web_Map_Service.py` takes user input, which is passed to `get_layers` function, in which `url` is used with `get_wms_layer` method. `get_wms_layer` method creates a request to arbitrary destinations, leading to blind server-side request forgery. Commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489 fixes this issue.",
