  "Description": "In SAP Commerce, valid user accounts can be\nidentified during the customer registration and login processes. This allows a\npotential attacker to learn if a given e-mail is used for an account, but does\nnot grant access to any customer data beyond this knowledge. The attacker must\nalready know the e-mail that they wish to test for. The impact on\nconfidentiality therefore is low and no impact to integrity or availability",
