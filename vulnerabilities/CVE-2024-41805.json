  "Description": "Tracks, a Getting Things Done (GTD) web application, is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting in versions prior to 2.7.1. Reflected cross-site scripting enables execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of a user\u2019s browser if that user clicks on a malicious link, allowing phishing attacks that could lead to credential theft. Tracks version 2.7.1 is patched. No known complete workarounds are available.",
