  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Fix NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_log_flush\n\nIn gfs2_jindex_free(), set sdp->sd_jdesc to NULL under the log flush\nlock to provide exclusion against gfs2_log_flush().\n\nIn gfs2_log_flush(), check if sdp->sd_jdesc is non-NULL before\ndereferencing it.  Otherwise, we could run into a NULL pointer\ndereference when outstanding glock work races with an unmount\n(glock_work_func -> run_queue -> do_xmote -> inode_go_sync ->\ngfs2_log_flush).",
