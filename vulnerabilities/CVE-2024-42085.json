  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: core: remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid deadlock\n\nWhen config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger system\nto enter suspend status with below command:\necho mem > /sys/power/state\nThere will be a deadlock issue occurring. Detailed invoking path as\nbelow:\ndwc3_suspend_common()\n    spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);              <-- 1st\n    dwc3_gadget_suspend(dwc);\n        dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect(dwc);\n            spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);      <-- 2nd\nThis issue is exposed by commit c7ebd8149ee5 (\"usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix\nNULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend\") that removes the code\nof checking whether dwc->gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes the\nfollowing code is executed and deadlock occurs when trying to get the\nspinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442(\"usb: dwc3:\nRemove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume\") that forgot to remove\nthe lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode during\ngadget suspend/resume.",
