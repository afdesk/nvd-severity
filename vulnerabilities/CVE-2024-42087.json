  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panel: ilitek-ili9881c: Fix warning with GPIO controllers that sleep\n\nThe ilitek-ili9881c controls the reset GPIO using the non-sleeping\ngpiod_set_value() function. This complains loudly when the GPIO\ncontroller needs to sleep. As the caller can sleep, use\ngpiod_set_value_cansleep() to fix the issue.",
