  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/dpaa2: Avoid explicit cpumask var allocation on stack\n\nFor CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=y kernel, explicit allocation of cpumask\nvariable on stack is not recommended since it can cause potential stack\noverflow.\n\nInstead, kernel code should always use *cpumask_var API(s) to allocate\ncpumask var in config-neutral way, leaving allocation strategy to\nCONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK.\n\nUse *cpumask_var API(s) to address it.",
