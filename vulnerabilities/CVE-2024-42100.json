  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common\n\nIn order to set the rate range of a hw sunxi_ccu_probe calls\nhw_to_ccu_common() assuming all entries in desc->ccu_clks are contained\nin a ccu_common struct. This assumption is incorrect and, in\nconsequence, causes invalid pointer de-references.\n\nRemove the faulty call. Instead, add one more loop that iterates over\nthe ccu_clks and sets the rate range, if required.",
