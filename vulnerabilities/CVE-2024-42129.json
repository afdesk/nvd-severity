  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nleds: mlxreg: Use devm_mutex_init() for mutex initialization\n\nIn this driver LEDs are registered using devm_led_classdev_register()\nso they are automatically unregistered after module's remove() is done.\nled_classdev_unregister() calls module's led_set_brightness() to turn off\nthe LEDs and that callback uses mutex which was destroyed already\nin module's remove() so use devm API instead.",
