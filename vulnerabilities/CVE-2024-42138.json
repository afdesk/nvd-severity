  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: core_linecards: Fix double memory deallocation in case of invalid INI file\n\nIn case of invalid INI file mlxsw_linecard_types_init() deallocates memory\nbut doesn't reset pointer to NULL and returns 0. In case of any error\noccurred after mlxsw_linecard_types_init() call, mlxsw_linecards_init()\ncalls mlxsw_linecard_types_fini() which performs memory deallocation again.\n\nAdd pointer reset to NULL.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
