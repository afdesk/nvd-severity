  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/mm: Add NULL pointer check to crst_table_free() base_crst_free()\n\ncrst_table_free() used to work with NULL pointers before the conversion\nto ptdescs.  Since crst_table_free() can be called with a NULL pointer\n(error handling in crst_table_upgrade() add an explicit check.\n\nAlso add the same check to base_crst_free() for consistency reasons.\n\nIn real life this should not happen, since order two GFP_KERNEL\nallocations will not fail, unless FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC is enabled and used.",
