  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: cs_dsp: Return error if block header overflows file\n\nReturn an error from cs_dsp_power_up() if a block header is longer\nthan the amount of data left in the file.\n\nThe previous code in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_load_coeff() would loop\nwhile there was enough data left in the file for a valid region. This\nprotected against overrunning the end of the file data, but it didn't\nabort the file processing with an error.",
