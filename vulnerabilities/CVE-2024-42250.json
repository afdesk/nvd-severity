  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachefiles: add missing lock protection when polling\n\nAdd missing lock protection in poll routine when iterating xarray,\notherwise:\n\nEven with RCU read lock held, only the slot of the radix tree is\nensured to be pinned there, while the data structure (e.g. struct\ncachefiles_req) stored in the slot has no such guarantee.  The poll\nroutine will iterate the radix tree and dereference cachefiles_req\naccordingly.  Thus RCU read lock is not adequate in this case and\nspinlock is needed here.",
