  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: use memtostr_pad() for s_volume_name\n\nAs with the other strings in struct ext4_super_block, s_volume_name is\nnot NUL terminated. The other strings were marked in commit 072ebb3bffe6\n(\"ext4: add nonstring annotations to ext4.h\"). Using strscpy() isn't\nthe right replacement for strncpy(); it should use memtostr_pad()\ninstead.",
