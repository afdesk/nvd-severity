  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: huge_memory: use !CONFIG_64BIT to relax huge page alignment on 32 bit machines\n\nYves-Alexis Perez reported commit 4ef9ad19e176 (\"mm: huge_memory: don't\nforce huge page alignment on 32 bit\") didn't work for x86_32 [1].  It is\nbecause x86_32 uses CONFIG_X86_32 instead of CONFIG_32BIT.\n\n!CONFIG_64BIT should cover all 32 bit machines.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/CAHbLzkr1LwH3pcTgM+aGQ31ip2bKqiqEQ8=FQB+t2c3dhNKNHA@mail.gmail.com/",
