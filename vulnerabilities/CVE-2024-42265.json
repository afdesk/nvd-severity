  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nprotect the fetch of ->fd[fd] in do_dup2() from mispredictions\n\nboth callers have verified that fd is not greater than ->max_fds;\nhowever, misprediction might end up with\n        tofree = fdt->fd[fd];\nbeing speculatively executed.  That's wrong for the same reasons\nwhy it's wrong in close_fd()/file_close_fd_locked(); the same\nsolution applies - array_index_nospec(fd, fdt->max_fds) could differ\nfrom fd only in case of speculative execution on mispredicted path.",
