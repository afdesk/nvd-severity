  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs\n\niw_conn_req_handler() associates a new struct rdma_id_private (conn_id) with\nan existing struct iw_cm_id (cm_id) as follows:\n\n        conn_id->cm_id.iw = cm_id;\n        cm_id->context = conn_id;\n        cm_id->cm_handler = cma_iw_handler;\n\nrdma_destroy_id() frees both the cm_id and the struct rdma_id_private. Make\nsure that cm_work_handler() does not trigger a use-after-free by only\nfreeing of the struct rdma_id_private after all pending work has finished.",
