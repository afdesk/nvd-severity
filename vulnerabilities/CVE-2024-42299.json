  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: Update log->page_{mask,bits} if log->page_size changed\n\nIf an NTFS file system is mounted to another system with different\nPAGE_SIZE from the original system, log->page_size will change in\nlog_replay(), but log->page_{mask,bits} don't change correspondingly.\nThis will cause a panic because \"u32 bytes = log->page_size - page_off\"\nwill get a negative value in the later read_log_page().",
