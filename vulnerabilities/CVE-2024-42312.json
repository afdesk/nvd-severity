  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsysctl: always initialize i_uid/i_gid\n\nAlways initialize i_uid/i_gid inside the sysfs core so set_ownership()\ncan safely skip setting them.\n\nCommit 5ec27ec735ba (\"fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c: fix the default values of\ni_uid/i_gid on /proc/sys inodes.\") added defaults for i_uid/i_gid when\nset_ownership() was not implemented. It also missed adjusting\nnet_ctl_set_ownership() to use the same default values in case the\ncomputation of a better value failed.",
