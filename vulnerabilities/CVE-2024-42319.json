  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable()\n\nWhen mtk-cmdq unbinds, a WARN_ON message with condition\npm_runtime_get_sync() < 0 occurs.\n\nAccording to the call tracei below:\n  cmdq_mbox_shutdown\n  mbox_free_channel\n  mbox_controller_unregister\n  __devm_mbox_controller_unregister\n  ...\n\nThe root cause can be deduced to be calling pm_runtime_get_sync() after\ncalling pm_runtime_disable() as observed below:\n1. CMDQ driver uses devm_mbox_controller_register() in cmdq_probe()\n   to bind the cmdq device to the mbox_controller, so\n   devm_mbox_controller_unregister() will automatically unregister\n   the device bound to the mailbox controller when the device-managed\n   resource is removed. That means devm_mbox_controller_unregister()\n   and cmdq_mbox_shoutdown() will be called after cmdq_remove().\n2. CMDQ driver also uses devm_pm_runtime_enable() in cmdq_probe() after\n   devm_mbox_controller_register(), so that devm_pm_runtime_disable()\n   will be called after cmdq_remove(), but before\n   devm_mbox_controller_unregister().\n\nTo fix this problem, cmdq_probe() needs to move\ndevm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() to make\ndevm_pm_runtime_disable() be called after\ndevm_mbox_controller_unregister().",
