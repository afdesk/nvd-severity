  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/dasd: fix error checks in dasd_copy_pair_store()\n\ndasd_add_busid() can return an error via ERR_PTR() if an allocation\nfails. However, two callsites in dasd_copy_pair_store() do not check\nthe result, potentially resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. Fix\nthis by checking the result with IS_ERR() and returning the error up\nthe stack.",
