  "Description": "actions/artifact is the GitHub ToolKit for developing GitHub Actions.  Versions of `actions/artifact` before 2.1.7 are vulnerable to arbitrary file write when using `downloadArtifactInternal`, `downloadArtifactPublic`, or `streamExtractExternal` for extracting a specifically crafted artifact that contains path traversal filenames. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.1.7 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
