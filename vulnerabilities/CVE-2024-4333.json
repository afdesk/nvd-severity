  "Description": "The Sina Extension for Elementor (Slider, Gallery, Form, Modal, Data Table, Tab, Particle, Free Elementor Widgets & Elementor Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 3.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
