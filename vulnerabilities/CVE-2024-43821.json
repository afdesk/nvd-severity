  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Fix a possible null pointer dereference\n\nIn function lpfc_xcvr_data_show, the memory allocation with kmalloc might\nfail, thereby making rdp_context a null pointer. In the following context\nand functions that use this pointer, there are dereferencing operations,\nleading to null pointer dereference.\n\nTo fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null,\nuse scnprintf to notify the user and return len.",
