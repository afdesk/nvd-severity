  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix infinite loop when replaying fast_commit\n\nWhen doing fast_commit replay an infinite loop may occur due to an\nuninitialized extent_status struct.  ext4_ext_determine_insert_hole() does\nnot detect the replay and calls ext4_es_find_extent_range(), which will\nreturn immediately without initializing the 'es' variable.\n\nBecause 'es' contains garbage, an integer overflow may happen causing an\ninfinite loop in this function, easily reproducible using fstest generic/039.\n\nThis commit fixes this issue by unconditionally initializing the structure\nin function ext4_es_find_extent_range().\n\nThanks to Zhang Yi, for figuring out the real problem!",
