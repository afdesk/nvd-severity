These are sub-device to sub-device links and\nif the async notifier is related to a V4L2 device, the source sub-device\nof the ancillary link is NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\nCheck the notifier's sd field is non-NULL in\nv4l2_async_create_ancillary_links().\n\n[Sakari Ailus: Reword the subject and commit messages slightly.]",
