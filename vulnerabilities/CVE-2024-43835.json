  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio_net: Fix napi_skb_cache_put warning\n\nAfter the commit bdacf3e34945 (\"net: Use nested-BH locking for\nnapi_alloc_cache.\") was merged, the following warning began to appear:\n\n\t WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1 at net/core/skbuff.c:1451 napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\n\n\t  __warn+0x12f/0x340\n\t  napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\n\t  napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\n\t  report_bug+0x165/0x370\n\t  handle_bug+0x3d/0x80\n\t  exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x50\n\t  asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n\t  __free_old_xmit+0x1c8/0x510\n\t  napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0\n\t  __free_old_xmit+0x1c8/0x510\n\t  __free_old_xmit+0x1c8/0x510\n\t  __pfx___free_old_xmit+0x10/0x10\n\nThe issue arises because virtio is assuming it's running in NAPI context\neven when it's not, such as in the netpoll case.\n\nTo resolve this, modify virtnet_poll_tx() to only set NAPI when budget\nis available. Same for virtnet_poll_cleantx(), which always assumed that\nit was in a NAPI context.",
