  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: fix overflow check in adjust_jmp_off()\n\nadjust_jmp_off() incorrectly used the insn->imm field for all overflow check,\nwhich is incorrect as that should only be done or the BPF_JMP32 | BPF_JA case,\nnot the general jump instruction case. Fix it by using insn->off for overflow\ncheck in the general case.",
