  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtw89: Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter()\n\nIn rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() 'status->he_gi' is compared to array size.\nBut then 'rate->he_gi' is used as array index instead of 'status->he_gi'.\nThis can lead to go beyond array boundaries in case of 'rate->he_gi' is\nnot equal to 'status->he_gi' and is bigger than array size. Looks like\n\"copy-paste\" mistake.\n\nFix this mistake by replacing 'rate->he_gi' with 'status->he_gi'.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
