  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (ltc2991) re-order conditions to fix off by one bug\n\nLTC2991_T_INT_CH_NR is 4.  The st->temp_en[] array has LTC2991_MAX_CHANNEL\n(4) elements.  Thus if \"channel\" is equal to LTC2991_T_INT_CH_NR then we\nhave read one element beyond the end of the array.  Flip the conditions\naround so that we check if \"channel\" is valid before using it as an array\nindex.",
