  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau: prime: fix refcount underflow\n\nCalling nouveau_bo_ref() on a nouveau_bo without initializing it (and\nhence the backing ttm_bo) leads to a refcount underflow.\n\nInstead of calling nouveau_bo_ref() in the unwind path of\ndrm_gem_object_init(), clean things up manually.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 1b93f3e89d03cfc576636e195466a0d728ad8de5)",
