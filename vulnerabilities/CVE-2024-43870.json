  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf: Fix event leak upon exit\n\nWhen a task is scheduled out, pending sigtrap deliveries are deferred\nto the target task upon resume to userspace via task_work.\n\nHowever failures while adding an event's callback to the task_work\nengine are ignored. And since the last call for events exit happen\nafter task work is eventually closed, there is a small window during\nwhich pending sigtrap can be queued though ignored, leaking the event\nrefcount addition such as in the following scenario:\n\n    TASK A\n    -----\n\n    do_exit()\n       exit_task_work(tsk);\n\n       <IRQ>\n       perf_event_overflow()\n          event->pending_sigtrap = pending_id;\n          irq_work_queue(&event->pending_irq);\n       </IRQ>\n    =========> PREEMPTION: TASK A -> TASK B\n       event_sched_out()\n          event->pending_sigtrap = 0;\n          atomic_long_inc_not_zero(&event->refcount)\n          // FAILS: task work has exited\n          task_work_add(&event->pending_task)\n       [...]\n       <IRQ WORK>\n       perf_pending_irq()\n          // early return: event->oncpu = -1\n       </IRQ WORK>\n       [...]\n    =========> TASK B -> TASK A\n       perf_event_exit_task(tsk)\n          perf_event_exit_event()\n             free_event()\n                WARN(atomic_long_cmpxchg(&event->refcount, 1, 0) != 1)\n                // leak event due to unexpected refcount == 2\n\nAs a result the event is never released while the task exits.\n\nFix this with appropriate task_work_add()'s error handling.",
