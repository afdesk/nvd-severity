  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: pci: ivtv: Add check for DMA map result\n\nIn case DMA fails, 'dma->SG_length' is 0. This value is later used to\naccess 'dma->SGarray[dma->SG_length - 1]', which will cause out of\nbounds access.\n\nAdd check to return early on invalid value. Adjust warnings accordingly.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
