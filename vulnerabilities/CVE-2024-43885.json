  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix double inode unlock for direct IO sync writes\n\nIf we do a direct IO sync write, at btrfs_sync_file(), and we need to skip\ninode logging or we get an error starting a transaction or an error when\nflushing delalloc, we end up unlocking the inode when we shouldn't under\nthe 'out_release_extents' label, and then unlock it again at\nbtrfs_direct_write().\n\nFix that by checking if we have to skip inode unlocking under that label.",
