  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add null check in resource_log_pipe_topology_update\n\n[WHY]\nWhen switching from \"Extend\" to \"Second Display Only\" we sometimes\ncall resource_get_otg_master_for_stream on a stream for the eDP,\nwhich is disconnected. This leads to a null pointer dereference.\n\n[HOW]\nAdded a null check in dc_resource.c/resource_log_pipe_topology_update.",
