  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: intel-vbtn: Protect ACPI notify handler against recursion\n\nSince commit e2ffcda16290 (\"ACPI: OSL: Allow Notify () handlers to run on\nall CPUs\") ACPI notify handlers like the intel-vbtn notify_handler() may\nrun on multiple CPU cores racing with themselves.\n\nThis race gets hit on Dell Venue 7140 tablets when undocking from\nthe keyboard, causing the handler to try and register priv->switches_dev\ntwice, as can be seen from the dev_info() message getting logged twice:\n\n[ 83.861800] intel-vbtn INT33D6:00: Registering Intel Virtual Switches input-dev after receiving a switch event\n[ 83.861858] input: Intel Virtual Switches as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.0/PNP0C09:00/INT33D6:00/input/input17\n[ 83.861865] intel-vbtn INT33D6:00: Registering Intel Virtual Switches input-dev after receiving a switch event\n\nAfter which things go seriously wrong:\n[ 83.861872] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.0/PNP0C09:00/INT33D6:00/input/input17'\n...\n[ 83.861967] kobject: kobject_add_internal failed for input17 with -EEXIST, don't try to register things with the same name in the same directory.\n[ 83.877338] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n...\n\nProtect intel-vbtn notify_handler() from racing with itself with a mutex\nto fix this.",
