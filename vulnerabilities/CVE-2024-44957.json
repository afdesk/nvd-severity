  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen: privcmd: Switch from mutex to spinlock for irqfds\n\nirqfd_wakeup() gets EPOLLHUP, when it is called by\neventfd_release() by way of wake_up_poll(&ctx->wqh, EPOLLHUP), which\ngets called under spin_lock_irqsave(). We can't use a mutex here as it\nwill lead to a deadlock.\n\nFix it by switching over to a spin lock.",
