  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mgag200: Bind I2C lifetime to DRM device\n\nManaged cleanup with devm_add_action_or_reset() will release the I2C\nadapter when the underlying Linux device goes away. But the connector\nstill refers to it, so this cleanup leaves behind a stale pointer\nin struct drm_connector.ddc.\n\nBind the lifetime of the I2C adapter to the connector's lifetime by\nusing DRM's managed release. When the DRM device goes away (after\nthe Linux device) DRM will first clean up the connector and then\nclean up the I2C adapter.",
