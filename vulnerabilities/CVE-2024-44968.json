  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntick/broadcast: Move per CPU pointer access into the atomic section\n\nThe recent fix for making the take over of the broadcast timer more\nreliable retrieves a per CPU pointer in preemptible context.\n\nThis went unnoticed as compilers hoist the access into the non-preemptible\nregion where the pointer is actually used. But of course it's valid that\nthe compiler keeps it at the place where the code puts it which rightfully\ntriggers:\n\n  BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code:\n       caller is hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull+0x1c/0xc0\n\nMove it to the actual usage site which is in a non-preemptible region.",
