  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix a possible memory leak in bcm_sf2_mdio_register()\n\nbcm_sf2_mdio_register() calls of_phy_find_device() and then\nphy_device_remove() in a loop to remove existing PHY devices.\nof_phy_find_device() eventually calls bus_find_device(), which calls\nget_device() on the returned struct device * to increment the refcount.\nThe current implementation does not decrement the refcount, which causes\nmemory leak.\n\nThis commit adds the missing phy_device_free() call to decrement the\nrefcount via put_device() to balance the refcount.",
