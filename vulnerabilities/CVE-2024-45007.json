  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nchar: xillybus: Don't destroy workqueue from work item running on it\n\nTriggered by a kref decrement, destroy_workqueue() may be called from\nwithin a work item for destroying its own workqueue. This illegal\nsituation is averted by adding a module-global workqueue for exclusive\nuse of the offending work item. Other work items continue to be queued\non per-device workqueues to ensure performance.",
