  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()\n\nCommit 4733b65d82bd (\"nvme: start keep-alive after admin queue setup\")\nmoves starting keep-alive from nvme_start_ctrl() into\nnvme_init_ctrl_finish(), but don't move stopping keep-alive into\nnvme_uninit_ctrl(), so keep-alive work can be started and keep pending\nafter failing to start controller, finally use-after-free is triggered if\nnvme host driver is unloaded.\n\nThis patch fixes kernel panic when running nvme/004 in case that connection\nfailure is triggered, by moving stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl().\n\nThis way is reasonable because keep-alive is now started in\nnvme_init_ctrl_finish().",
