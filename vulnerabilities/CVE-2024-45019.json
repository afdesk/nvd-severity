  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Take state lock during tx timeout reporter\n\nmlx5e_safe_reopen_channels() requires the state lock taken. The\nreferenced changed in the Fixes tag removed the lock to fix another\nissue. This patch adds it back but at a later point (when calling\nmlx5e_safe_reopen_channels()) to avoid the deadlock referenced in the\nFixes tag.",
