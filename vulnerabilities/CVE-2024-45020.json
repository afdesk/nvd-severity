  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()\n\nDaniel Hodges reported a kernel verifier crash when playing with sched-ext.\nFurther investigation shows that the crash is due to invalid memory access\nin stacksafe(). More specifically, it is the following code:\n\n    if (exact != NOT_EXACT &&\n        old->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=\n        cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])\n            return false;\n\nThe 'i' iterates old->allocated_stack.\nIf cur->allocated_stack < old->allocated_stack the out-of-bound\naccess will happen.\n\nTo fix the issue add 'i >= cur->allocated_stack' check such that if\nthe condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise,\ncur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.",
