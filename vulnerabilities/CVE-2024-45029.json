  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safe\n\nOn ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to a\nmutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:\n\n\tBUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:585\n\t...\n\n\tCall trace:\n\t__might_sleep\n\t__mutex_lock_common\n\tmutex_lock_nested\n\tacpi_subsys_runtime_resume\n\trpm_resume\n\ttegra_i2c_xfer\n\nThe problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock\n&dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later,\nrpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies on\nmutexes, triggering the error.\n\nTo address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe,\nconsidering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.",
