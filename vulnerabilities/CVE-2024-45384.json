  "Description": "Padding Oracle vulnerability in Apache Druid extension, druid-pac4j.\nThis could allow an attacker to manipulate a pac4j session cookie.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Druid versions 0.18.0 through 30.0.0.\nSince the druid-pac4j extension is optional and disabled by default, Druid installations not using the druid-pac4j extension are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nWhile we are not aware of a way to meaningfully exploit this flaw, we \nnevertheless recommend upgrading to version 30.0.1 or higher which fixes the issue\nand ensuring you have a strong \ndruid.auth.pac4j.cookiePassphrase as a precaution.",
