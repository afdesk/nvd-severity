  "Description": "An issue was discovered in TitanHQ SpamTitan Email Security Gateway 8.00.x before 8.00.101 and 8.01.x before 8.01.14. The file quarantine.php within the SpamTitan interface allows unauthenticated users to trigger account-level actions using a crafted GET request. Notably, when a non-existent email address is provided as part of the email parameter, SpamTitan will automatically create a user record and associate quarantine settings with it - all without requiring authentication.",
