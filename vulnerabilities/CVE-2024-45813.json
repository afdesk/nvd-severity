  "Description": "find-my-way is a fast, open source HTTP router, internally using a Radix Tree (aka compact Prefix Tree), supports route params, wildcards, and it's framework independent. A bad regular expression is generated any time one has two parameters within a single segment, when adding a `-` at the end, like `/:a-:b-`. This may cause a denial of service in some instances. Users are advised to update to find-my-way v8.2.2 or v9.0.1. or subsequent versions. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
