  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: mipi-i3c-hci: Mask ring interrupts before ring stop request\n\nBus cleanup path in DMA mode may trigger a RING_OP_STAT interrupt when\nthe ring is being stopped. Depending on timing between ring stop request\ncompletion, interrupt handler removal and code execution this may lead\nto a NULL pointer dereference in hci_dma_irq_handler() if it gets to run\nafter the io_data pointer is set to NULL in hci_dma_cleanup().\n\nPrevent this my masking the ring interrupts before ring stop request.",
