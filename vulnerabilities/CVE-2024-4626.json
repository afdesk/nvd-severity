  "Description": "The JetWidgets For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018layout_type\u2019 and 'id' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.17 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
