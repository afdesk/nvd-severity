  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: aacraid: Fix double-free on probe failure\n\naac_probe_one() calls hardware-specific init functions through the\naac_driver_ident::init pointer, all of which eventually call down to\naac_init_adapter().\n\nIf aac_init_adapter() fails after allocating memory for aac_dev::queues,\nit frees the memory but does not clear that member.\n\nAfter the hardware-specific init function returns an error,\naac_probe_one() goes down an error path that frees the memory pointed to\nby aac_dev::queues, resulting.in a double-free.",
