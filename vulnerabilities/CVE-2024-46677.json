  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngtp: fix a potential NULL pointer dereference\n\nWhen sockfd_lookup() fails, gtp_encap_enable_socket() returns a\nNULL pointer, but its callers only check for error pointers thus miss\nthe NULL pointer case.\n\nFix it by returning an error pointer with the error code carried from\nsockfd_lookup().\n\n(I found this bug during code inspection.)",
