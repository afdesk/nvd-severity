  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir\n\nAfter we switch tmpfs dir operations from simple_dir_operations to\nsimple_offset_dir_operations, every rename happened will fill new dentry\nto dest dir's maple tree(&SHMEM_I(inode)->dir_offsets->mt) with a free\nkey starting with octx->newx_offset, and then set newx_offset equals to\nfree key + 1. This will lead to infinite readdir combine with rename\nhappened at the same time, which fail generic/736 in xfstests(detail show\nas below).\n\n1. create 5000 files(1 2 3...) under one dir\n2. call readdir(man 3 readdir) once, and get one entry\n3. rename(entry, \"TEMPFILE\"), then rename(\"TEMPFILE\", entry)\n4. loop 2~3, until readdir return nothing or we loop too many\n   times(tmpfs break test with the second condition)\n\nWe choose the same logic what commit 9b378f6ad48cf (\"btrfs: fix infinite\ndirectory reads\") to fix it, record the last_index when we open dir, and\ndo not emit the entry which index >= last_index. The file->private_data\nnow used in offset dir can use directly to do this, and we also update\nthe last_index when we llseek the dir file.\n\n[brauner: only update last_index after seek when offset is zero like Jan suggested]",
