  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: arm64: Make ICC_*SGI*_EL1 undef in the absence of a vGICv3\n\nOn a system with a GICv3, if a guest hasn't been configured with\nGICv3 and that the host is not capable of GICv2 emulation,\na write to any of the ICC_*SGI*_EL1 registers is trapped to EL2.\n\nWe therefore try to emulate the SGI access, only to hit a NULL\npointer as no private interrupt is allocated (no GIC, remember?).\n\nThe obvious fix is to give the guest what it deserves, in the\nshape of a UNDEF exception.",
