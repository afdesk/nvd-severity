  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: altera-msgdma: properly free descriptor in msgdma_free_descriptor\n\nRemove list_del call in msgdma_chan_desc_cleanup, this should be the role\nof msgdma_free_descriptor. In consequence replace list_add_tail with\nlist_move_tail in msgdma_free_descriptor.\n\nThis fixes the path:\n   msgdma_free_chan_resources -> msgdma_free_descriptors ->\n   msgdma_free_desc_list -> msgdma_free_descriptor\n\nwhich does not correctly free the descriptors as first nodes were not\nremoved from the list.",
