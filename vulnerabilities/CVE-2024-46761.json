  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npci/hotplug/pnv_php: Fix hotplug driver crash on Powernv\n\nThe hotplug driver for powerpc (pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c) causes a kernel\ncrash when we try to hot-unplug/disable the PCIe switch/bridge from\nthe PHB.\n\nThe crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has been\nreleased during disable/hot-unplug path and it has been assigned\nwith NULL, still during unregistration the code was again trying to\nexplicitly disable the MSI which causes the NULL pointer dereference and\nkernel crash.\n\nThe patch fixes the check during unregistration path to prevent invoking\npci_disable_msi/msix() since its data structure is already freed.",
