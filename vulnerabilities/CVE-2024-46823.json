  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkunit/overflow: Fix UB in overflow_allocation_test\n\nThe 'device_name' array doesn't exist out of the\n'overflow_allocation_test' function scope. However, it is being used as\na driver name when calling 'kunit_driver_create' from\n'kunit_device_register'. It produces the kernel panic with KASAN\nenabled.\n\nSince this variable is used in one place only, remove it and pass the\ndevice name into kunit_device_register directly as an ascii string.",
