  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuserfaultfd: don't BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page table\n\nSince khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in file\nmappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are wrong - get\nrid of them.\n\nWe could also remove the preceding \"if (unlikely(...))\" block, but then we\ncould reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for file\nmappings but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be fine\nbut I think is not necessarily expected.",
