  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info\n\nThe MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and the\nroutine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless of\nreturn status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware\nreturns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region\nreferences previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.\n\nFix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox\nresource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not\ntimeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources\nbecause it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later\ntime in its cmpl routine.\n\nAlso, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot\nscripts requiring longer timeouts.",
