  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: vmalloc: ensure vmap_block is initialised before adding to queue\n\nCommit 8c61291fd850 (\"mm: fix incorrect vbq reference in\npurge_fragmented_block\") extended the 'vmap_block' structure to contain a\n'cpu' field which is set at allocation time to the id of the initialising\nCPU.\n\nWhen a new 'vmap_block' is being instantiated by new_vmap_block(), the\npartially initialised structure is added to the local 'vmap_block_queue'\nxarray before the 'cpu' field has been initialised.  If another CPU is\nconcurrently walking the xarray (e.g.  via vm_unmap_aliases()), then it\nmay perform an out-of-bounds access to the remote queue thanks to an\nuninitialised index.\n\nThis has been observed as UBSAN errors in Android:\n\n | Internal error: UBSAN: array index out of bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n |\n | Call trace:\n |  purge_fragmented_block+0x204/0x21c\n |  _vm_unmap_aliases+0x170/0x378\n |  vm_unmap_aliases+0x1c/0x28\n |  change_memory_common+0x1dc/0x26c\n |  set_memory_ro+0x18/0x24\n |  module_enable_ro+0x98/0x238\n |  do_init_module+0x1b0/0x310\n\nMove the initialisation of 'vb->cpu' in new_vmap_block() ahead of the\naddition to the xarray.",
