  "Description": "Diebold Nixdorf Vynamic Security Suite through 4.3.0 SR06 contains functionality that allows the removal of critical system files before the filesystem is properly mounted (e.g., leveraging a delete call in /etc/rc.d/init.d/mountfs to remove the /etc/fstab file). This can allow code execution and, in some versions, enable recovery of TPM Disk Encryption keys and decryption of the Windows system partition.",
