  "Description": "In the goTenna Pro App, the encryption keys are stored along with a \nstatic IV on the End User Device (EUD). This allows for complete \ndecryption of keys stored on the EUD if physically compromised. This \nallows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications \nbased on encryption keys stored on the EUD. This requires access to and \ncontrol of the EUD, so it is recommended to use strong access control \nmeasures and layered encryption on the EUD for more secure operation.",
