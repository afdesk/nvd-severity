  "Description": "A\u00a0NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a specific command is executed, the pfe crashes.\u00a0This will cause traffic forwarding to be interrupted until the system self-recovers. Repeated execution will create a sustained DoS condition.\n\n This issue only affects MX Series devices with Line cards MPC1-MPC9.\nThis issue affects:\nJunos OS on MX Series: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.",
