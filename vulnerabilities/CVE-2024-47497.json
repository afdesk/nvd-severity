  "Description": "An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the http daemon (httpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series, QFX Series, MX Series and EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nAn attacker can send specific HTTPS connection requests to the device, triggering the creation of processes that are not properly terminated. Over time, this leads to resource exhaustion, ultimately causing the device to crash and restart.\n\nThe following command can be used to monitor the resource usage:\nuser@host> show system processes extensive | match mgd | count\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series and EX Series:\nAll versions before 21.4R3-S7,\nfrom 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,\nfrom 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,\nfrom 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2,\nfrom 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,\nfrom 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.",
