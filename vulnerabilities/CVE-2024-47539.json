  "Description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was identified in the convert_to_s334_1a function in isomp4/qtdemux.c. The vulnerability arises due to a discrepancy between the size of memory allocated to the storage array and the loop condition i * 2 < ccpair_size. Specifically, when ccpair_size is even, the allocated size in storage does not match the loop's expected bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This bug allows for the overwriting of up to 3 bytes beyond the allocated bounds of the storage array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
