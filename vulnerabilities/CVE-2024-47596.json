  "Description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read has been discovered in the qtdemux_parse_svq3_stsd_data function within qtdemux.c. In the FOURCC_SMI_ case, seqh_size is read from the input file without proper validation. If seqh_size is greater than the remaining size of the data buffer, it can lead to an OOB-read in the following call to gst_buffer_fill, which internally uses memcpy. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
