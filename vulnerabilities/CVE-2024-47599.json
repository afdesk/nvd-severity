  "Description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_jpeg_dec_negotiate function in gstjpegdec.c. This function does not check for a NULL return value from gst_video_decoder_set_output_state. When this happens, dereferences of the outstate pointer will lead to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
