  "Description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_matroska_demux_update_tracks function within matroska-demux.c. The vulnerability occurs when the gst_caps_is_equal function is called with invalid caps values. If this happen, then in the function gst_buffer_get_size the call to GST_BUFFER_MEM_PTR can return a null pointer. Attempting to dereference the size field of this null pointer results in a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
