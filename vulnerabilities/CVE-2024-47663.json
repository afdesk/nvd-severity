  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: iio: frequency: ad9834: Validate frequency parameter value\n\nIn ad9834_write_frequency() clk_get_rate() can return 0. In such case\nad9834_calc_freqreg() call will lead to division by zero. Checking\n'if (fout > (clk_freq / 2))' doesn't protect in case of 'fout' is 0.\nad9834_write_frequency() is called from ad9834_write(), where fout is\ntaken from text buffer, which can contain any value.\n\nModify parameters checking.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
