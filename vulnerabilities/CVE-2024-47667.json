  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: keystone: Add workaround for Errata #i2037 (AM65x SR 1.0)\n\nErrata #i2037 in AM65x/DRA80xM Processors Silicon Revision 1.0\n(SPRZ452D_July 2018_Revised December 2019 [1]) mentions when an\ninbound PCIe TLP spans more than two internal AXI 128-byte bursts,\nthe bus may corrupt the packet payload and the corrupt data may\ncause associated applications or the processor to hang.\n\nThe workaround for Errata #i2037 is to limit the maximum read\nrequest size and maximum payload size to 128 bytes. Add workaround\nfor Errata #i2037 here.\n\nThe errata and workaround is applicable only to AM65x SR 1.0 and\nlater versions of the silicon will have this fixed.\n\n[1] -> https://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz452i/sprz452i.pdf",
