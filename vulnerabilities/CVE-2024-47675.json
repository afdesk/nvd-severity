  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix use-after-free in bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach()\n\nIf bpf_link_prime() fails, bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach() goes to the\nerror_free label and frees the array of bpf_uprobe's without calling\nbpf_uprobe_unregister().\n\nThis leaks bpf_uprobe->uprobe and worse, this frees bpf_uprobe->consumer\nwithout removing it from the uprobe->consumers list.",
