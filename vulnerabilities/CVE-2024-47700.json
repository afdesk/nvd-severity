  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: check stripe size compatibility on remount as well\n\nWe disable stripe size in __ext4_fill_super if it is not a multiple of\nthe cluster ratio however this check is missed when trying to remount.\nThis can leave us with cases where stripe < cluster_ratio after\nremount:set making EXT4_B2C(sbi->s_stripe) become 0 that can cause some\nunforeseen bugs like divide by 0.\n\nFix that by adding the check in remount path as well.",
