  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/tdx: Fix \"in-kernel MMIO\" check\n\nTDX only supports kernel-initiated MMIO operations. The handle_mmio()\nfunction checks if the #VE exception occurred in the kernel and rejects\nthe operation if it did not.\n\nHowever, userspace can deceive the kernel into performing MMIO on its\nbehalf. For example, if userspace can point a syscall to an MMIO address,\nsyscall does get_user() or put_user() on it, triggering MMIO #VE. The\nkernel will treat the #VE as in-kernel MMIO.\n\nEnsure that the target MMIO address is within the kernel before decoding\ninstruction.",
