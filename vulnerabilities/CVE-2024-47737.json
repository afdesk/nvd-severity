  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: call cache_put if xdr_reserve_space returns NULL\n\nIf not enough buffer space available, but idmap_lookup has triggered\nlookup_fn which calls cache_get and returns successfully. Then we\nmissed to call cache_put here which pairs with cache_get.\n\nReviwed-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>",
