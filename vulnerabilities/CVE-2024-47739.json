  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npadata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow\n\nWhen submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, the\ncurrent sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with\noverflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in\nthe reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process\nas padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processed\nbecause the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected\nnext.\n\nTo fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort\npadata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.",
