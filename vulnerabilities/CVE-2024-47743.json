  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKEYS: prevent NULL pointer dereference in find_asymmetric_key()\n\nIn find_asymmetric_key(), if all NULLs are passed in the id_{0,1,2}\narguments, the kernel will first emit WARN but then have an oops\nbecause id_2 gets dereferenced anyway.\n\nAdd the missing id_2 check and move WARN_ON() to the final else branch\nto avoid duplicate NULL checks.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Svace static\nanalysis tool.",
