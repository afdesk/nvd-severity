  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/cxgb4: Added NULL check for lookup_atid\n\nThe lookup_atid() function can return NULL if the ATID is\ninvalid or does not exist in the identifier table, which\ncould lead to dereferencing a null pointer without a\ncheck in the `act_establish()` and `act_open_rpl()` functions.\nAdd a NULL check to prevent null pointer dereferencing.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
