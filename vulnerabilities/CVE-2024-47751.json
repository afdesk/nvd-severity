  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: kirin: Fix buffer overflow in kirin_pcie_parse_port()\n\nWithin kirin_pcie_parse_port(), the pcie->num_slots is compared to\npcie->gpio_id_reset size (MAX_PCI_SLOTS) which is correct and would lead\nto an overflow.\n\nThus, fix condition to pcie->num_slots + 1 >= MAX_PCI_SLOTS and move\npcie->num_slots increment below the if-statement to avoid out-of-bounds\narray access.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log]",
