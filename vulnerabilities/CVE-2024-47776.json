{
  "Description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read has been discovered in gst_wavparse_cue_chunk within gstwavparse.c. The vulnerability happens due to a discrepancy between the size of the data buffer and the size value provided to the function. This mismatch causes the comparison  if (size < 4 + ncues * 24) to fail in some cases, allowing the subsequent loop to access beyond the bounds of the data buffer. The root cause of this discrepancy stems from a miscalculation when clipping the chunk size based on upstream data size. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
