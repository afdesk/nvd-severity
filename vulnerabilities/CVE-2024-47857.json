  "Description": "SSH Communication Security PrivX versions between 18.0-36.0 implement insufficient validation on public key signatures when using native SSH connections via a proxy port. This allows an existing PrivX \"account A\" to impersonate another existing PrivX \"account B\" and gain access to SSH target hosts to which the \"account B\" has access.",
