  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Sangoma Asterisk through 18.20.0, 19.x and 20.x through 20.5.0, and 21.x through 21.0.0, and Certified Asterisk through 18.9-cert5. In manager.c, the functions action_getconfig() and action_getconfigJson() do not process the input file path, resulting in a path traversal vulnerability. In versions without the restrictedFile() function, no processing is done on the input path. In versions with the restrictedFile() function, path traversal is not processed.",
