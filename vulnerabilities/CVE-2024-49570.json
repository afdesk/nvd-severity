  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/tracing: Fix a potential TP_printk UAF\n\nThe commit\nafd2627f727b (\"tracing: Check \"%s\" dereference via the field and not the TP_printk format\")\nexposes potential UAFs in the xe_bo_move trace event.\n\nFix those by avoiding dereferencing the\nxe_mem_type_to_name[] array at TP_printk time.\n\nSince some code refactoring has taken place, explicit backporting may\nbe needed for kernels older than 6.10.",
