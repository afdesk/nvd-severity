  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in COMOS V10.3 (All versions < V10.3.3.5.8), COMOS V10.4.0 (All versions), COMOS V10.4.1 (All versions), COMOS V10.4.2 (All versions), COMOS V10.4.3 (All versions < V10.4.3.0.47), COMOS V10.4.4 (All versions < V10.4.4.2), COMOS V10.4.4.1 (All versions < V10.4.4.1.21). The Generic Data Mapper, the Engineering Adapter, and the Engineering Interface improperly handle XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing configuration and mapping files. This could allow an attacker to extract any file with a known location on the user's system or accessible network folders by persuading a user to use a maliciously crafted configuration or mapping file in one of the affected components.",
