  "Description": "Internet Starter, one of SoftCOM iKSORIS system modules, is vulnerable to client-side Denial of Servise (DoS) attacks. An attacker might trick a user into using an URL with a d parameter set to an unhandled value. All the subsequent requests will not be accepted as the server returns an error message. Since this parameter is sent as part of a session cookie, the issue persists until the session expires or the user deletes cookies manually.\u00a0\nSimilar effect might be achieved when\u00a0a user tries to change platform language to an unimplemented one.\nThis vulnerability has been patched in version 79.0",
