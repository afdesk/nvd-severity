  "Description": "IBM OpenPages with Watson 8.3 and 9.0 \n\ncould provide weaker than expected security in storage of encrypted data with AES encryption and CBC mode. If an authenticated remote attacker with access to the database or a local attacker with access to server files could extract the encrypted data values they could exploit this weaker algorithm to use additional cryptographic methods to possibly extract the encrypted data.",
