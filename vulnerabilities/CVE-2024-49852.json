  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: elx: libefc: Fix potential use after free in efc_nport_vport_del()\n\nThe kref_put() function will call nport->release if the refcount drops to\nzero.  The nport->release release function is _efc_nport_free() which frees\n\"nport\".  But then we dereference \"nport\" on the next line which is a use\nafter free.  Re-order these lines to avoid the use after free.",
