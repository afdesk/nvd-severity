  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock, bfq: fix uaf for accessing waker_bfqq after splitting\n\nAfter commit 42c306ed7233 (\"block, bfq: don't break merge chain in\nbfq_split_bfqq()\"), if the current procress is the last holder of bfqq,\nthe bfqq can be freed after bfq_split_bfqq(). Hence recored the bfqq and\nthen access bfqq->waker_bfqq may trigger UAF. What's more, the waker_bfqq\nmay in the merge chain of bfqq, hence just recored waker_bfqq is still\nnot safe.\n\nFix the problem by adding a helper bfq_waker_bfqq() to check if\nbfqq->waker_bfqq is in the merge chain, and current procress is the only\nholder.",
