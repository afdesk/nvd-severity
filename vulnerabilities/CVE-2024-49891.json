  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Validate hdwq pointers before dereferencing in reset/errata paths\n\nWhen the HBA is undergoing a reset or is handling an errata event, NULL ptr\ndereference crashes may occur in routines such as\nlpfc_sli_flush_io_rings(), lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_callbk(), or\nlpfc_abort_handler().\n\nAdd NULL ptr checks before dereferencing hdwq pointers that may have been\nfreed due to operations colliding with a reset or errata event handler.",
