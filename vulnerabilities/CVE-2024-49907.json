  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using dc->clk_mgr\n\n[WHY & HOW]\ndc->clk_mgr is null checked previously in the same function, indicating\nit might be null.\n\nPassing \"dc\" to \"dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations\", which\ndereferences null \"dc->clk_mgr\". (The function pointer resolves to\n\"dcn35_apply_idle_power_optimizations\".)\n\nThis fixes 1 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.",
