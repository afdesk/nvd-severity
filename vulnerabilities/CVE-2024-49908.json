  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add null check for 'afb' in amdgpu_dm_update_cursor (v2)\n\nThis commit adds a null check for the 'afb' variable in the\namdgpu_dm_update_cursor function. Previously, 'afb' was assumed to be\nnull at line 8388, but was used later in the code without a null check.\nThis could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.\n\nChanges since v1:\n- Moved the null check for 'afb' to the line where 'afb' is used. (Alex)\n\nFixes the below:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c:8433 amdgpu_dm_update_cursor()\n\terror: we previously assumed 'afb' could be null (see line 8388)",
