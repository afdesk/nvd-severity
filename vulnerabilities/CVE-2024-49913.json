  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add null check for top_pipe_to_program in commit_planes_for_stream\n\nThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in the\n`commit_planes_for_stream` function at line 4140. The issue could occur\nwhen `top_pipe_to_program` is null.\n\nThe fix adds a check to ensure `top_pipe_to_program` is not null before\naccessing its stream_res. This prevents a null pointer dereference.\n\nReported by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc.c:4140 commit_planes_for_stream() error: we previously assumed 'top_pipe_to_program' could be null (see line 3906)",
