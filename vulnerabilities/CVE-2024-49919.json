  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add null check for head_pipe in dcn201_acquire_free_pipe_for_layer\n\nThis commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the\n`dcn201_acquire_free_pipe_for_layer` function. The issue could occur\nwhen `head_pipe` is null.\n\nThe fix adds a check to ensure `head_pipe` is not null before asserting\nit. If `head_pipe` is null, the function returns NULL to prevent a\npotential null pointer dereference.\n\nReported by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn201/dcn201_resource.c:1016 dcn201_acquire_free_pipe_for_layer() error: we previously assumed 'head_pipe' could be null (see line 1010)",
