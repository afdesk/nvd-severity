  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid NULL pointer dereference\n\niwl_mvm_tx_skb_sta() and iwl_mvm_tx_mpdu() verify that the mvmvsta\npointer is not NULL.\nIt retrieves this pointer using iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211, which is\ndereferencing the ieee80211_sta pointer.\nIf sta is NULL, iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211 will dereference a NULL\npointer.\nFix this by checking the sta pointer before retrieving the mvmsta\nfrom it. If sta is not NULL, then mvmsta isn't either.",
