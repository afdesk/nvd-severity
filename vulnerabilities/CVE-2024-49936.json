  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/xen-netback: prevent UAF in xenvif_flush_hash()\n\nDuring the list_for_each_entry_rcu iteration call of xenvif_flush_hash,\nkfree_rcu does not exist inside the rcu read critical section, so if\nkfree_rcu is called when the rcu grace period ends during the iteration,\nUAF occurs when accessing head->next after the entry becomes free.\n\nTherefore, to solve this, you need to change it to list_for_each_entry_safe.",
