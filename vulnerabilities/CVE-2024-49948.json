  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: add more sanity checks to qdisc_pkt_len_init()\n\nOne path takes care of SKB_GSO_DODGY, assuming\nskb->len is bigger than hdr_len.\n\nvirtio_net_hdr_to_skb() does not fully dissect TCP headers,\nit only make sure it is at least 20 bytes.\n\nIt is possible for an user to provide a malicious 'GSO' packet,\ntotal length of 80 bytes.\n\n- 20 bytes of IPv4 header\n- 60 bytes TCP header\n- a small gso_size like 8\n\nvirtio_net_hdr_to_skb() would declare this packet as a normal\nGSO packet, because it would see 40 bytes of payload,\nbigger than gso_size.\n\nWe need to make detect this case to not underflow\nqdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len.",
