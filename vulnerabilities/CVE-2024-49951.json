  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: MGMT: Fix possible crash on mgmt_index_removed\n\nIf mgmt_index_removed is called while there are commands queued on\ncmd_sync it could lead to crashes like the bellow trace:\n\n0x0000053D: __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x98/0xdc\n0x0000053D: mgmt_pending_remove+0x18/0x58 [bluetooth]\n0x0000053E: mgmt_remove_adv_monitor_complete+0x80/0x108 [bluetooth]\n0x0000053E: hci_cmd_sync_work+0xbc/0x164 [bluetooth]\n\nSo while handling mgmt_index_removed this attempts to dequeue\ncommands passed as user_data to cmd_sync.",
