  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstatic_call: Replace pointless WARN_ON() in static_call_module_notify()\n\nstatic_call_module_notify() triggers a WARN_ON(), when memory allocation\nfails in __static_call_add_module().\n\nThat's not really justified, because the failure case must be correctly\nhandled by the well known call chain and the error code is passed\nthrough to the initiating userspace application.\n\nA memory allocation fail is not a fatal problem, but the WARN_ON() takes\nthe machine out when panic_on_warn is set.\n\nReplace it with a pr_warn().",
