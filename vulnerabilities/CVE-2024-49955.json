  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: battery: Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hook\n\nWhen a battery hook returns an error when adding a new battery, then\nthe battery hook is automatically unregistered.\nHowever the battery hook provider cannot know that, so it will later\ncall battery_hook_unregister() on the already unregistered battery\nhook, resulting in a crash.\n\nFix this by using the list head to mark already unregistered battery\nhooks as already being unregistered so that they can be ignored by\nbattery_hook_unregister().",
