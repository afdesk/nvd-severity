  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: fix double destroy_workqueue error\n\nWhen gfs2_fill_super() fails, destroy_workqueue() is called within\ngfs2_gl_hash_clear(), and the subsequent code path calls\ndestroy_workqueue() on the same work queue again.\n\nThis issue can be fixed by setting the work queue pointer to NULL after\nthe first destroy_workqueue() call and checking for a NULL pointer\nbefore attempting to destroy the work queue again.",
