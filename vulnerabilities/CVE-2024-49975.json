  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuprobes: fix kernel info leak via \"[uprobes]\" vma\n\nxol_add_vma() maps the uninitialized page allocated by __create_xol_area()\ninto userspace. On some architectures (x86) this memory is readable even\nwithout VM_READ, VM_EXEC results in the same pgprot_t as VM_EXEC|VM_READ,\nalthough this doesn't really matter, debugger can read this memory anyway.",
