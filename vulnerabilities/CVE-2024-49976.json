  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing/timerlat: Drop interface_lock in stop_kthread()\n\nstop_kthread() is the offline callback for \"trace/osnoise:online\", since\ncommit 5bfbcd1ee57b (\"tracing/timerlat: Add interface_lock around clearing\nof kthread in stop_kthread()\"), the following ABBA deadlock scenario is\nintroduced:\n\nT1                            | T2 [BP]               | T3 [AP]\nosnoise_hotplug_workfn()      | work_for_cpu_fn()     | cpuhp_thread_fun()\n                              |   _cpu_down()         |   osnoise_cpu_die()\n  mutex_lock(&interface_lock) |                       |     stop_kthread()\n                              |     cpus_write_lock() |       mutex_lock(&interface_lock)\n  cpus_read_lock()            |     cpuhp_kick_ap()   |\n\nAs the interface_lock here in just for protecting the \"kthread\" field of\nthe osn_var, use xchg() instead to fix this issue. Also use\nfor_each_online_cpu() back in stop_per_cpu_kthreads() as it can take\ncpu_read_lock() again.",
