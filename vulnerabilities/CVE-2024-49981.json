  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: venus: fix use after free bug in venus_remove due to race condition\n\nin venus_probe, core->work is bound with venus_sys_error_handler, which is\nused to handle error. The code use core->sys_err_done to make sync work.\nThe core->work is started in venus_event_notify.\n\nIf we call venus_remove, there might be an unfished work. The possible\nsequence is as follows:\n\nCPU0                  CPU1\n\n                     |venus_sys_error_handler\nvenus_remove         |\nhfi_destroy\t \t\t |\nvenus_hfi_destroy\t |\nkfree(hdev);\t     |\n                     |hfi_reinit\n\t\t\t\t\t |venus_hfi_queues_reinit\n                     |//use hdev\n\nFix it by canceling the work in venus_remove.",
