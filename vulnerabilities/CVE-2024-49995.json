  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntipc: guard against string buffer overrun\n\nSmatch reports that copying media_name and if_name to name_parts may\noverwrite the destination.\n\n .../bearer.c:166 bearer_name_validate() error: strcpy() 'media_name' too large for 'name_parts->media_name' (32 vs 16)\n .../bearer.c:167 bearer_name_validate() error: strcpy() 'if_name' too large for 'name_parts->if_name' (1010102 vs 16)\n\nThis does seem to be the case so guard against this possibility by using\nstrscpy() and failing if truncation occurs.\n\nIntroduced by commit b97bf3fd8f6a (\"[TIPC] Initial merge\")\n\nCompile tested only.",
