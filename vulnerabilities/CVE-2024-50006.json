  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()\n\nFuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.\n\nThis issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require\nsynchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.\nThis can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling\njbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the\nEXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.\n\nThis problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this\ncase, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the\njbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers\nlockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same\njbd2_handle simultaneously.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller.\n\nRule: add",
