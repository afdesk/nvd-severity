  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()\n\ndst_entries_add() uses per-cpu data that might be freed at netns\ndismantle from ip6_route_net_exit() calling dst_entries_destroy()\n\nBefore ip6_route_net_exit() can be called, we release all\nthe dsts associated with this netns, via calls to dst_release(),\nwhich waits an rcu grace period before calling dst_destroy()\n\ndst_entries_add() use in dst_destroy() is racy, because\ndst_entries_destroy() could have been called already.\n\nDecrementing the number of dsts must happen sooner.\n\nNotes:\n\n1) in CONFIG_XFRM case, dst_destroy() can call\n   dst_release_immediate(child), this might also cause UAF\n   if the child does not have DST_NOCOUNT set.\n   IPSEC maintainers might take a look and see how to address this.\n\n2) There is also discussion about removing this count of dst,\n   which might happen in future kernels.",
