  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix possible badness in FREE_STATEID\n\nWhen multiple FREE_STATEIDs are sent for the same delegation stateid,\nit can lead to a possible either use-after-free or counter refcount\nunderflow errors.\n\nIn nfsd4_free_stateid() under the client lock we find a delegation\nstateid, however the code drops the lock before calling nfs4_put_stid(),\nthat allows another FREE_STATE to find the stateid again. The first one\nwill proceed to then free the stateid which leads to either\nuse-after-free or decrementing already zeroed counter.",
