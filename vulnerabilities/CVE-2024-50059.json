  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nntb: ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix use after free vulnerability in switchtec_ntb_remove due to race condition\n\nIn the switchtec_ntb_add function, it can call switchtec_ntb_init_sndev\nfunction, then &sndev->check_link_status_work is bound with\ncheck_link_status_work. switchtec_ntb_link_notification may be called\nto start the work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call switchtec_ntb_remove to make\ncleanup, it will free sndev through kfree(sndev), while the work\nmentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead\nto a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                 CPU1\n\n                        | check_link_status_work\nswitchtec_ntb_remove    |\nkfree(sndev);           |\n                        | if (sndev->link_force_down)\n                        | // use sndev\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with\nthe cleanup in switchtec_ntb_remove.",
