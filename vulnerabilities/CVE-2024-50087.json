  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free on read_alloc_one_name() error\n\nThe function read_alloc_one_name() does not initialize the name field of\nthe passed fscrypt_str struct if kmalloc fails to allocate the\ncorresponding buffer.  Thus, it is not guaranteed that\nfscrypt_str.name is initialized when freeing it.\n\nThis is a follow-up to the linked patch that fixes the remaining\ninstances of the bug introduced by commit e43eec81c516 (\"btrfs: use\nstruct qstr instead of name and namelen pairs\").",
