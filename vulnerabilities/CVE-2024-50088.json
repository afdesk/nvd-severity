  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free in add_inode_ref()\n\nThe add_inode_ref() function does not initialize the \"name\" struct when\nit is declared.  If any of the following calls to \"read_one_inode()\nreturns NULL,\n\n\tdir = read_one_inode(root, parent_objectid);\n\tif (!dir) {\n\t\tret = -ENOENT;\n\t\tgoto out;\n\t}\n\n\tinode = read_one_inode(root, inode_objectid);\n\tif (!inode) {\n\t\tret = -EIO;\n\t\tgoto out;\n\t}\n\nthen \"name.name\" would be freed on \"out\" before being initialized.\n\nout:\n\t...\n\tkfree(name.name);\n\nThis issue was reported by Coverity with CID 1526744.",
