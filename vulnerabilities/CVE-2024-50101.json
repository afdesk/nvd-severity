  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices\n\nPreviously, the domain_context_clear() function incorrectly called\npci_for_each_dma_alias() to set up context entries for non-PCI devices.\nThis could lead to kernel hangs or other unexpected behavior.\n\nAdd a check to only call pci_for_each_dma_alias() for PCI devices. For\nnon-PCI devices, domain_context_clear_one() is called directly.",
