The latter need to take the rescan lock when adding devices or\nwe may end up in an undefined state having two incompletely added devices\nand hit the following crash when trying to remove the device over sysfs:\n\n  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000\n  Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] SMP\n  Call trace:\n    __pi_strlen+0x14/0x150\n    kernfs_find_ns+0x80/0x13c\n    kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0x54/0xf0\n    sysfs_remove_bin_file+0x24/0x34\n    pci_remove_resource_files+0x3c/0x84\n    pci_remove_sysfs_dev_files+0x28/0x38\n    pci_stop_bus_device+0x8c/0xd8\n    pci_stop_bus_device+0x40/0xd8\n    pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device_locked+0x28/0x48\n    remove_store+0x70/0xb0\n    dev_attr_store+0x20/0x38\n    sysfs_kf_write+0x58/0x78\n    kernfs_fop_write_iter+0xe8/0x184\n    vfs_write+0x2dc/0x308\n    ksys_write+0x7c/0xec",
