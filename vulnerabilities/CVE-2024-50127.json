  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_change()\n\nIn 'taprio_change()', 'admin' pointer may become dangling due to sched\nswitch / removal caused by 'advance_sched()', and critical section\nprotected by 'q->current_entry_lock' is too small to prevent from such\na scenario (which causes use-after-free detected by KASAN). Fix this\nby prefer 'rcu_replace_pointer()' over 'rcu_assign_pointer()' to update\n'admin' immediately before an attempt to schedule freeing.",
