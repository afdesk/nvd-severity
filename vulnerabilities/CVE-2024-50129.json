  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: pse-pd: Fix out of bound for loop\n\nAdjust the loop limit to prevent out-of-bounds access when iterating over\nPI structures. The loop should not reach the index pcdev->nr_lines since\nwe allocate exactly pcdev->nr_lines number of PI structures. This fix\nensures proper bounds are maintained during iterations.",
