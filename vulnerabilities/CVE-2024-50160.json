  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda/cs8409: Fix possible NULL dereference\n\nIf snd_hda_gen_add_kctl fails to allocate memory and returns NULL, then\nNULL pointer dereference will occur in the next line.\n\nSince dolphin_fixups function is a hda_fixup function which is not supposed\nto return any errors, add simple check before dereference, ignore the fail.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
