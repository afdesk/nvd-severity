  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nposix-clock: Fix missing timespec64 check in pc_clock_settime()\n\nAs Andrew pointed out, it will make sense that the PTP core\nchecked timespec64 struct's tv_sec and tv_nsec range before calling\nptp->info->settime64().\n\nAs the man manual of clock_settime() said, if tp.tv_sec is negative or\ntp.tv_nsec is outside the range [0..999,999,999], it should return EINVAL,\nwhich include dynamic clocks which handles PTP clock, and the condition is\nconsistent with timespec64_valid(). As Thomas suggested, timespec64_valid()\nonly check the timespec is valid, but not ensure that the time is\nin a valid range, so check it ahead using timespec64_valid_strict()\nin pc_clock_settime() and return -EINVAL if not valid.\n\nThere are some drivers that use tp->tv_sec and tp->tv_nsec directly to\nwrite registers without validity checks and assume that the higher layer\nhas checked it, which is dangerous and will benefit from this, such as\nhclge_ptp_settime(), igb_ptp_settime_i210(), _rcar_gen4_ptp_settime(),\nand some drivers can remove the checks of itself.",
