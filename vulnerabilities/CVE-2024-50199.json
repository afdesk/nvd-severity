  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/swapfile: skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vma\n\nI got a bad pud error and lost a 1GB HugeTLB when calling swapoff.  The\nproblem can be reproduced by the following steps:\n\n 1. Allocate an anonymous 1GB HugeTLB and some other anonymous memory.\n 2. Swapout the above anonymous memory.\n 3. run swapoff and we will get a bad pud error in kernel message:\n\n  mm/pgtable-generic.c:42: bad pud 00000000743d215d(84000001400000e7)\n\nWe can tell that pud_clear_bad is called by pud_none_or_clear_bad in\nunuse_pud_range() by ftrace.  And therefore the HugeTLB pages will never\nbe freed because we lost it from page table.  We can skip HugeTLB pages\nfor unuse_vma to fix it.",
