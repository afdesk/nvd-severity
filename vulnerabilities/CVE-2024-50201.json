  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: Fix encoder->possible_clones\n\nInclude the encoder itself in its possible_clones bitmask.\nIn the past nothing validated that drivers were populating\npossible_clones correctly, but that changed in commit\n74d2aacbe840 (\"drm: Validate encoder->possible_clones\").\nLooks like radeon never got the memo and is still not\nfollowing the rules 100% correctly.\n\nThis results in some warnings during driver initialization:\nBogus possible_clones: [ENCODER:46:TV-46] possible_clones=0x4 (full encoder mask=0x7)\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 170 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_mode_config.c:615 drm_mode_config_validate+0x113/0x39c\n...\n\n(cherry picked from commit 3b6e7d40649c0d75572039aff9d0911864c689db)",
