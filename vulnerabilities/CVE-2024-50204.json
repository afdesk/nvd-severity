  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: don't try and remove empty rbtree node\n\nWhen copying a namespace we won't have added the new copy into the\nnamespace rbtree until after the copy succeeded. Calling free_mnt_ns()\nwill try to remove the copy from the rbtree which is invalid. Simply\nfree the namespace skeleton directly.",
