  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: firewire-lib: Avoid division by zero in apply_constraint_to_size()\n\nThe step variable is initialized to zero. It is changed in the loop,\nbut if it's not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable check\nbefore the division.\n\nThe observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b\n(\"ALSA: firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size\"),\nand it is difficult to show that any of the interval parameters will\nsatisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data from the\namdtp_rate_table[] table.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
