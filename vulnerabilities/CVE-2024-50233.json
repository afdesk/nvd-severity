  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: iio: frequency: ad9832: fix division by zero in ad9832_calc_freqreg()\n\nIn the ad9832_write_frequency() function, clk_get_rate() might return 0.\nThis can lead to a division by zero when calling ad9832_calc_freqreg().\nThe check if (fout > (clk_get_rate(st->mclk) / 2)) does not protect\nagainst the case when fout is 0. The ad9832_write_frequency() function\nis called from ad9832_write(), and fout is derived from a text buffer,\nwhich can contain any value.",
