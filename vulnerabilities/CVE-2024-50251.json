  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nft_payload: sanitize offset and length before calling skb_checksum()\n\nIf access to offset + length is larger than the skbuff length, then\nskb_checksum() triggers BUG_ON().\n\nskb_checksum() internally subtracts the length parameter while iterating\nover skbuff, BUG_ON(len) at the end of it checks that the expected\nlength to be included in the checksum calculation is fully consumed.",
