  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: v4l2-tpg: prevent the risk of a division by zero\n\nAs reported by Coverity, the logic at tpg_precalculate_line()\nblindly rescales the buffer even when scaled_witdh is equal to\nzero. If this ever happens, this will cause a division by zero.\n\nInstead, add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to trigger such cases and return\nwithout doing any precalculation.",
