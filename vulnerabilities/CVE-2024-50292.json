  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: stm32: spdifrx: fix dma channel release in stm32_spdifrx_remove\n\nIn case of error when requesting ctrl_chan DMA channel, ctrl_chan is not\nnull. So the release of the dma channel leads to the following issue:\n[    4.879000] st,stm32-spdifrx 500d0000.audio-controller:\ndma_request_slave_channel error -19\n[    4.888975] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference\nat virtual address 000000000000003d\n[...]\n[    5.096577] Call trace:\n[    5.099099]  dma_release_channel+0x24/0x100\n[    5.103235]  stm32_spdifrx_remove+0x24/0x60 [snd_soc_stm32_spdifrx]\n[    5.109494]  stm32_spdifrx_probe+0x320/0x4c4 [snd_soc_stm32_spdifrx]\n\nTo avoid this issue, release channel only if the pointer is valid.",
