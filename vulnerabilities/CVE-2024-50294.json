  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls\n\nIf a call gets aborted (e.g. because kafs saw a signal) between it being\nqueued for connection and the I/O thread picking up the call, the abort\nwill be prioritised over the connection and it will be removed from\nlocal->new_client_calls by rxrpc_disconnect_client_call() without a lock\nbeing held.  This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race\noccurs.\n\nFix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever\nlist its ->wait_link happens to be on.",
