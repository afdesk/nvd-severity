  "Description": "An issue in KIA Seltos vehicle instrument cluster with software and hardware v1.0 allows attackers to control or disrupt CAN communication between the instrument cluster and CAN bus. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the findings came from a potentially unrealistic test environment (an isolated ECU part that was not in a vehicle), and because the observed behavior follows the UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) specification.",
