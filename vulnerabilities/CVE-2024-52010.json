  "Description": "Zoraxy is a general purpose HTTP reverse proxy and forwarding tool. A command injection vulnerability in the Web SSH feature allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the host. Zoraxy has a Web SSH terminal feature that allows authenticated users to connect to SSH servers from their browsers. In HandleCreateProxySession the request to create an SSH session is handled. An attacker can exploit the username variable to escape from the bash command and inject arbitrary commands into sshCommand. This is possible, because, unlike hostname and port, the username is not validated or sanitized.",
