  "Description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.10.11, the Python parser parses newlines in chunk extensions incorrectly which can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.10.11 fixes the issue.",
