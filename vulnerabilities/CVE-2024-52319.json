  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: use aligned address in clear_gigantic_page()\n\nIn current kernel, hugetlb_no_page() calls folio_zero_user() with the\nfault address.  Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge\npage size.  Then, folio_zero_user() may call clear_gigantic_page() with\nthe address, while clear_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge\npage size aligned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or information\nleak, addtional, use more obvious naming 'addr_hint' instead of 'addr' for\nclear_gigantic_page().",
