  "Description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson` allows an attacker to create fake user profiles and forged notes. The spoofed users will appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist, and the forged notes will appear to be posted by a different user. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept the spoofed objects as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate other users and instances. The attacker retains full control of the spoofed user / note and can interact like a real account. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
