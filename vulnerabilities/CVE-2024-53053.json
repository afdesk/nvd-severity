  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: core: Fix another deadlock during RTC update\n\nIf ufshcd_rtc_work calls ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() and the pm's usage_count\nis 0, we will enter the runtime suspend callback.  However, the runtime\nsuspend callback will wait to flush ufshcd_rtc_work, causing a deadlock.\n\nReplace ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() with ufshcd_rpm_put() to avoid the\ndeadlock.",
