  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: Fix potential NULL dereference in mtk_crtc_destroy()\n\nIn mtk_crtc_create(), if the call to mbox_request_channel() fails then we\nset the \"mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan\" pointer to NULL.  In that situation,\nwe do not call cmdq_pkt_create().\n\nDuring the cleanup, we need to check if the \"mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan\"\nis NULL first before calling cmdq_pkt_destroy().  Calling\ncmdq_pkt_destroy() is unnecessary if we didn't call cmdq_pkt_create() and\nit will result in a NULL pointer dereference.",
