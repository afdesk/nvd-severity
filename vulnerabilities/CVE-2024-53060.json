  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: prevent NULL pointer dereference if ATIF is not supported\n\nacpi_evaluate_object() may return AE_NOT_FOUND (failure), which\nwould result in dereferencing buffer.pointer (obj) while being NULL.\n\nAlthough this case may be unrealistic for the current code, it is\nstill better to protect against possible bugs.\n\nBail out also when status is AE_NOT_FOUND.\n\nThis fixes 1 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity\nReport: CID 1600951:  Null pointer dereferences  (FORWARD_NULL)\n\n(cherry picked from commit 91c9e221fe2553edf2db71627d8453f083de87a1)",
