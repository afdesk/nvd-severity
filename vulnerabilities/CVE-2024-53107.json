  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/proc/task_mmu: prevent integer overflow in pagemap_scan_get_args()\n\nThe \"arg->vec_len\" variable is a u64 that comes from the user at the start\nof the function.  The \"arg->vec_len * sizeof(struct page_region))\"\nmultiplication can lead to integer wrapping.  Use size_mul() to avoid\nthat.\n\nAlso the size_add/mul() functions work on unsigned long so for 32bit\nsystems we need to ensure that \"arg->vec_len\" fits in an unsigned long.",
