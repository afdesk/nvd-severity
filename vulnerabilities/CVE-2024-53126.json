  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvdpa: solidrun: Fix UB bug with devres\n\nIn psnet_open_pf_bar() and snet_open_vf_bar() a string later passed to\npcim_iomap_regions() is placed on the stack. Neither\npcim_iomap_regions() nor the functions it calls copy that string.\n\nShould the string later ever be used, this, consequently, causes\nundefined behavior since the stack frame will by then have disappeared.\n\nFix the bug by allocating the strings on the heap through\ndevm_kasprintf().",
