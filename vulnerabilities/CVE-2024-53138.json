  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix incorrect page refcounting\n\nThe kTLS tx handling code is using a mix of get_page() and\npage_ref_inc() APIs to increment the page reference. But on the release\npath (mlx5e_ktls_tx_handle_resync_dump_comp()), only put_page() is used.\n\nThis is an issue when using pages from large folios: the get_page()\nreferences are stored on the folio page while the page_ref_inc()\nreferences are stored directly in the given page. On release the folio\npage will be dereferenced too many times.\n\nThis was found while doing kTLS testing with sendfile() + ZC when the\nserved file was read from NFS on a kernel with NFS large folios support\n(commit 49b29a573da8 (\"nfs: add support for large folios\")).",
