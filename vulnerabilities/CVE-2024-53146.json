  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSD: Prevent a potential integer overflow\n\nIf the tag length is >= U32_MAX - 3 then the \"length + 4\" addition\ncan result in an integer overflow. Address this by splitting the\ndecoding into several steps so that decode_cb_compound4res() does\nnot have to perform arithmetic on the unsafe length value.",
