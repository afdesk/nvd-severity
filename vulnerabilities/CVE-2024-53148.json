  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Flush partial mappings in error case\n\nIf some remap_pfn_range() calls succeeded before one failed, we still have\nbuffer pages mapped into the userspace page tables when we drop the buffer\nreference with comedi_buf_map_put(bm). The userspace mappings are only\ncleaned up later in the mmap error path.\n\nFix it by explicitly flushing all mappings in our VMA on the error path.\n\nSee commit 79a61cc3fc04 (\"mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in\nerror case\").",
