  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: fix warning when unbinding\n\nIf there is an error during some initialization related to firmware,\nthe buffers dp->tx_ring[i].tx_status are released.\nHowever this is released again when the device is unbinded (ath12k_pci),\nand we get:\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2098 at mm/slub.c:4689 free_large_kmalloc+0x4d/0x80\nCall Trace:\nfree_large_kmalloc\nath12k_dp_free\nath12k_core_deinit\nath12k_pci_remove\n...\n\nThe issue is always reproducible from a VM because the MSI addressing\ninitialization is failing.\n\nIn order to fix the issue, just set the buffers to NULL after releasing in\norder to avoid the double free.",
