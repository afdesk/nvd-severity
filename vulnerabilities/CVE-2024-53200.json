  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in hwss_setup_dpp\n\nThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in\nhwss_setup_dpp(). The issue could occur when pipe_ctx->plane_state is\nnull. The fix adds a check to ensure `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is not null\nbefore accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference.",
