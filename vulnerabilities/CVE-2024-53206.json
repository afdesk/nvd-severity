  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: Fix use-after-free of nreq in reqsk_timer_handler().\n\nThe cited commit replaced inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop_and_put() with\n__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop() and reqsk_put() in reqsk_timer_handler().\n\nThen, oreq should be passed to reqsk_put() instead of req; otherwise\nuse-after-free of nreq could happen when reqsk is migrated but the\nretry attempt failed (e.g. due to timeout).\n\nLet's pass oreq to reqsk_put().",
