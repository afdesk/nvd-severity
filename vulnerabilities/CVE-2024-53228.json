  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: kvm: Fix out-of-bounds array access\n\nIn kvm_riscv_vcpu_sbi_init() the entry->ext_idx can contain an\nout-of-bound index. This is used as a special marker for the base\nextensions, that cannot be disabled. However, when traversing the\nextensions, that special marker is not checked prior indexing the\narray.\n\nAdd an out-of-bounds check to the function.",
