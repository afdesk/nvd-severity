  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: 6fire: Release resources at card release\n\nThe current 6fire code tries to release the resources right after the\ncall of usb6fire_chip_abort().  But at this moment, the card object\nmight be still in use (as we're calling snd_card_free_when_closed()).\n\nFor avoid potential UAFs, move the release of resources to the card's\nprivate_free instead of the manual call of usb6fire_chip_destroy() at\nthe USB disconnect callback.",
