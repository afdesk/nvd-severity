  "Description": "The Login/Signup Popup ( Inline Form + Woocommerce ) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'import_settings' function in versions 2.7.1 to 2.7.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary options on affected sites.
