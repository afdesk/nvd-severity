  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: prevent use of deleted inode\n\nsyzbot reported a WARNING in nilfs_rmdir. [1]\n\nBecause the inode bitmap is corrupted, an inode with an inode number that\nshould exist as a \".nilfs\" file was reassigned by nilfs_mkdir for \"file0\",\ncausing an inode duplication during execution.  And this causes an\nunderflow of i_nlink in rmdir operations.\n\nThe inode is used twice by the same task to unmount and remove directories\n\".nilfs\" and \"file0\", it trigger warning in nilfs_rmdir.\n\nAvoid to this issue, check i_nlink in nilfs_iget(), if it is 0, it means\nthat this inode has been deleted, and iput is executed to reclaim it.\n\n[1]\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5824 at fs/inode.c:407 drop_nlink+0xc4/0x110 fs/inode.c:407\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n nilfs_rmdir+0x1b0/0x250 fs/nilfs2/namei.c:342\n vfs_rmdir+0x3a3/0x510 fs/namei.c:4394\n do_rmdir+0x3b5/0x580 fs/namei.c:4453\n __do_sys_rmdir fs/namei.c:4472 [inline]\n __se_sys_rmdir fs/namei.c:4470 [inline]\n __x64_sys_rmdir+0x47/0x50 fs/namei.c:4470\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x230 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f",
