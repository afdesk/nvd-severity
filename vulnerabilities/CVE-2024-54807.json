  "Description": "In Netgear WNR854T 1.5.2 (North America), the UPNP service is vulnerable to command injection in the function addmap_exec which parses the NewInternalClient parameter of the AddPortMapping SOAPAction into a system call without sanitation. An attacker can send a specially crafted SOAPAction request for AddPortMapping via the router's WANIPConn1 service to achieve arbitrary command execution.",
