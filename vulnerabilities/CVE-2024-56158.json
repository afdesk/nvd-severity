  "Description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. It's possible to execute any SQL query in Oracle by using the function like DBMS_XMLGEN or DBMS_XMLQUERY. The XWiki query validator does not sanitize functions that would be used in a simple select and Hibernate allows using any native function in an HQL query. This vulnerability is fixed in 16.10.2, 16.4.7, and 15.10.16.",
