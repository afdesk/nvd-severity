  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: us122l: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection\n\nThe USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-long\nwaiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at\ndisconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it\ncan take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, which\nmay trigger a soft lockup.\n\nAn easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() with\nsnd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while\nthe release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device\nrelease at the last close.\n\nThe loop of us122l->mmap_count check is dropped as well.  The check is\nuseless for the asynchronous operation with *_when_closed().",
