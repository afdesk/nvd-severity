  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mwifiex: Fix memcpy() field-spanning write warning in mwifiex_config_scan()\n\nReplace one-element array with a flexible-array member in `struct\nmwifiex_ie_types_wildcard_ssid_params` to fix the following warning\non a MT8173 Chromebook (mt8173-elm-hana):\n\n[  356.775250] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  356.784543] memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 6) of single field \"wildcard_ssid_tlv->ssid\" at drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c:904 (size 1)\n[  356.813403] WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 742 at drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c:904 mwifiex_scan_networks+0x4fc/0xf28 [mwifiex]\n\nThe \"(size 6)\" above is exactly the length of the SSID of the network\nthis device was connected to. The source of the warning looks like:\n\n    ssid_len = user_scan_in->ssid_list[i].ssid_len;\n    [...]\n    memcpy(wildcard_ssid_tlv->ssid,\n           user_scan_in->ssid_list[i].ssid, ssid_len);\n\nThere is a #define WILDCARD_SSID_TLV_MAX_SIZE that uses sizeof() on this\nstruct, but it already didn't account for the size of the one-element\narray, so it doesn't need to be changed.",
