  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncachefiles: Fix NULL pointer dereference in object->file\n\nAt present, the object->file has the NULL pointer dereference problem in\nondemand-mode. The root cause is that the allocated fd and object->file\nlifetime are inconsistent, and the user-space invocation to anon_fd uses\nobject->file. Following is the process that triggers the issue:\n\n\t  [write fd]\t\t\t\t[umount]\ncachefiles_ondemand_fd_write_iter\n\t\t\t\t       fscache_cookie_state_machine\n\t\t\t\t\t cachefiles_withdraw_cookie\n  if (!file) return -ENOBUFS\n\t\t\t\t\t   cachefiles_clean_up_object\n\t\t\t\t\t     cachefiles_unmark_inode_in_use\n\t\t\t\t\t     fput(object->file)\n\t\t\t\t\t     object->file = NULL\n  // file NULL pointer dereference!\n  __cachefiles_write(..., file, ...)\n\nFix this issue by add an additional reference count to the object->file\nbefore write/llseek, and decrement after it finished.",
