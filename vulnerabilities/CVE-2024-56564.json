  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: pass cred pointer to ceph_mds_auth_match()\n\nThis eliminates a redundant get_current_cred() call, because\nceph_mds_check_access() has already obtained this pointer.\n\nAs a side effect, this also fixes a reference leak in\nceph_mds_auth_match(): by omitting the get_current_cred() call, no\nadditional cred reference is taken.",
