  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/tctx: work around xa_store() allocation error issue\n\nsyzbot triggered the following WARN_ON:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 16 at io_uring/tctx.c:51 __io_uring_free+0xfa/0x140 io_uring/tctx.c:51\n\nwhich is the\n\nWARN_ON_ONCE(!xa_empty(&tctx->xa));\n\nsanity check in __io_uring_free() when a io_uring_task is going through\nits final put. The syzbot test case includes injecting memory allocation\nfailures, and it very much looks like xa_store() can fail one of its\nmemory allocations and end up with ->head being non-NULL even though no\nentries exist in the xarray.\n\nUntil this issue gets sorted out, work around it by attempting to\niterate entries in our xarray, and WARN_ON_ONCE() if one is found.",
