  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: inet: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in inet_create()\n\nsock_init_data() attaches the allocated sk object to the provided sock\nobject. If inet_create() fails later, the sk object is freed, but the\nsock object retains the dangling pointer, which may create use-after-free\nlater.\n\nClear the sk pointer in the sock object on error.",
