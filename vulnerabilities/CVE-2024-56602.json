  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ieee802154: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in ieee802154_create()\n\nsock_init_data() attaches the allocated sk object to the provided sock\nobject. If ieee802154_create() fails later, the allocated sk object is\nfreed, but the dangling pointer remains in the provided sock object, which\nmay allow use-after-free.\n\nClear the sk pointer in the sock object on error.",
