  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: RFCOMM: avoid leaving dangling sk pointer in rfcomm_sock_alloc()\n\nbt_sock_alloc() attaches allocated sk object to the provided sock object.\nIf rfcomm_dlc_alloc() fails, we release the sk object, but leave the\ndangling pointer in the sock object, which may cause use-after-free.\n\nFix this by swapping calls to bt_sock_alloc() and rfcomm_dlc_alloc().",
