  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: hi311x: hi3110_can_ist(): fix potential use-after-free\n\nThe commit a22bd630cfff (\"can: hi311x: do not report txerr and rxerr\nduring bus-off\") removed the reporting of rxerr and txerr even in case\nof correct operation (i. e. not bus-off).\n\nThe error count information added to the CAN frame after netif_rx() is\na potential use after free, since there is no guarantee that the skb\nis in the same state. It might be freed or reused.\n\nFix the issue by postponing the netif_rx() call in case of txerr and\nrxerr reporting.",
