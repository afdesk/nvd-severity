  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: DR, prevent potential error pointer dereference\n\nThe dr_domain_add_vport_cap() function generally returns NULL on error\nbut sometimes we want it to return ERR_PTR(-EBUSY) so the caller can\nretry.  The problem here is that \"ret\" can be either -EBUSY or -ENOMEM\nand if it's and -ENOMEM then the error pointer is propogated back and\neventually dereferenced in dr_ste_v0_build_src_gvmi_qpn_tag().",
