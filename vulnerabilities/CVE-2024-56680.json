  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: intel/ipu6: do not handle interrupts when device is disabled\n\nSome IPU6 devices have shared interrupts. We need to handle properly\ncase when interrupt is triggered from other device on shared irq line\nand IPU6 itself disabled. In such case we get 0xffffffff from\nISR_STATUS register and handle all irq's cases, for what we are not\nnot prepared and usually hang the whole system.\n\nTo avoid the issue use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to check if\nthe device is enabled and prevent suspending it when we handle irq\nuntil the end of irq. Additionally use synchronize_irq() in suspend",
