  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/riscv-aplic: Prevent crash when MSI domain is missing\n\nIf the APLIC driver is probed before the IMSIC driver, the parent MSI\ndomain will be missing, which causes a NULL pointer dereference in\nmsi_create_device_irq_domain().\n\nAvoid this by deferring probe until the parent MSI domain is available. Use\ndev_err_probe() to avoid printing an error message when returning\n-EPROBE_DEFER.",
