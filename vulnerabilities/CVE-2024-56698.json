  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: gadget: Fix looping of queued SG entries\n\nThe dwc3_request->num_queued_sgs is decremented on completion. If a\npartially completed request is handled, then the\ndwc3_request->num_queued_sgs no longer reflects the total number of\nnum_queued_sgs (it would be cleared).\n\nCorrectly check the number of request SG entries remained to be prepare\nand queued. Failure to do this may cause null pointer dereference when\naccessing non-existent SG entry.",
