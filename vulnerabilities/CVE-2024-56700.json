  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: wl128x: Fix atomicity violation in fmc_send_cmd()\n\nAtomicity violation occurs when the fmc_send_cmd() function is executed\nsimultaneously with the modification of the fmdev->resp_skb value.\nConsider a scenario where, after passing the validity check within the\nfunction, a non-null fmdev->resp_skb variable is assigned a null value.\nThis results in an invalid fmdev->resp_skb variable passing the validity\ncheck. As seen in the later part of the function, skb = fmdev->resp_skb;\nwhen the invalid fmdev->resp_skb passes the check, a null pointer\ndereference error may occur at line 478, evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data;\n\nTo address this issue, it is recommended to include the validity check of\nfmdev->resp_skb within the locked section of the function. This\nmodification ensures that the value of fmdev->resp_skb does not change\nduring the validation process, thereby maintaining its validity.\n\nThis possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool\ndeveloped by our team. This tool analyzes the locking APIs\nto extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then\nanalyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible\nconcurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations.",
