  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/cpum_sf: Fix and protect memory allocation of SDBs with mutex\n\nReservation of the PMU hardware is done at first event creation\nand is protected by a pair of mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock().\nAfter reservation of the PMU hardware the memory\nrequired for the PMUs the event is to be installed on is\nallocated by allocate_buffers() and alloc_sampling_buffer().\nThis done outside of the mutex protection.\nWithout mutex protection two or more concurrent invocations of\nperf_event_init() may run in parallel.\nThis can lead to allocation of Sample Data Blocks (SDBs)\nmultiple times for the same PMU.\nPrevent this and protect memory allocation of SDBs by\nmutex.",
