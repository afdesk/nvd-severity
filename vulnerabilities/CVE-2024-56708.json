  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nEDAC/igen6: Avoid segmentation fault on module unload\n\nThe segmentation fault happens because:\n\nDuring modprobe:\n1. In igen6_probe(), igen6_pvt will be allocated with kzalloc()\n2. In igen6_register_mci(), mci->pvt_info will point to\n   &igen6_pvt->imc[mc]\n\nDuring rmmod:\n1. In mci_release() in edac_mc.c, it will kfree(mci->pvt_info)\n2. In igen6_remove(), it will kfree(igen6_pvt);\n\nFix this issue by setting mci->pvt_info to NULL to avoid the double\nkfree.",
