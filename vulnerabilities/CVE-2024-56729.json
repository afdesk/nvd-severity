  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: Initialize cfid->tcon before performing network ops\n\nAvoid leaking a tcon ref when a lease break races with opening the\ncached directory. Processing the leak break might take a reference to\nthe tcon in cached_dir_lease_break() and then fail to release the ref in\ncached_dir_offload_close, since cfid->tcon is still NULL.",
