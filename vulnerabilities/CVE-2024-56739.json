  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtc: check if __rtc_read_time was successful in rtc_timer_do_work()\n\nIf the __rtc_read_time call fails,, the struct rtc_time tm; may contain\nuninitialized data, or an illegal date/time read from the RTC hardware.\n\nWhen calling rtc_tm_to_ktime later, the result may be a very large value\n(possibly KTIME_MAX). If there are periodic timers in rtc->timerqueue,\nthey will continually expire, may causing kernel softlockup.",
