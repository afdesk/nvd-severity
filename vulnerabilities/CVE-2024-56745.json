  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: Fix reset_method_store() memory leak\n\nIn reset_method_store(), a string is allocated via kstrndup() and assigned\nto the local \"options\". options is then used in with strsep() to find\nspaces:\n\n  while ((name = strsep(&options, \" \")) != NULL) {\n\nIf there are no remaining spaces, then options is set to NULL by strsep(),\nso the subsequent kfree(options) doesn't free the memory allocated via\nkstrndup().\n\nFix by using a separate tmp_options to iterate with strsep() so options is\npreserved.",
