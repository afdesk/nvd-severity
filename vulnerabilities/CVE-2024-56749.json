  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndlm: fix dlm_recover_members refcount on error\n\nIf dlm_recover_members() fails we don't drop the references of the\nprevious created root_list that holds and keep all rsbs alive during the\nrecovery. It might be not an unlikely event because ping_members() could\nrun into an -EINTR if another recovery progress was triggered again.",
