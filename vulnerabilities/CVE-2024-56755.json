  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING\n\nIn fscache_create_volume(), there is a missing memory barrier between the\nbit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a\nsituation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't been\ndetected yet, leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as\nfollows:\n\n  [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work]\nfscache_perform_lookup\n  fscache_create_volume\n                        fscache_perform_lookup\n                          fscache_create_volume\n\t\t\t                        fscache_create_volume_work\n                                                  cachefiles_acquire_volume\n                                                  clear_and_wake_up_bit\n    test_and_set_bit\n                            test_and_set_bit\n                              goto maybe_wait\n      goto no_wait\n\nIn the above process, cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1\nenters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting\nprocess. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the\n-wait- process indefinitely.\n\nIn commit 3288666c7256 (\"fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in\nfscache_create_volume_work()\"), barriers were added to similar operations\nin fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.\n\nBy combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to\nfix this issue.",
