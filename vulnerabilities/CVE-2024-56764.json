  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nublk: detach gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails\n\nInside ublk_abort_requests(), gendisk is grabbed for aborting all\ninflight requests. And ublk_abort_requests() is called when exiting\nthe uring context or handling timeout.\n\nIf add_disk() fails, the gendisk may have been freed when calling\nublk_abort_requests(), so use-after-free can be caused when getting\ndisk's reference in ublk_abort_requests().\n\nFixes the bug by detaching gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails.",
