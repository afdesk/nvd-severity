  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: add a sanity check for btrfs root in btrfs_search_slot()\n\nSyzbot reports a null-ptr-deref in btrfs_search_slot().\n\nThe reproducer is using rescue=ibadroots, and the extent tree root is\ncorrupted thus the extent tree is NULL.\n\nWhen scrub tries to search the extent tree to gather the needed extent\ninfo, btrfs_search_slot() doesn't check if the target root is NULL or\nnot, resulting the null-ptr-deref.\n\nAdd sanity check for btrfs root before using it in btrfs_search_slot().",
