  "Description": "Server-Side Access Control Bypass vulnerability in WombatDialer before 25.02 could allow unauthorized users to potentially call certain services without the necessary access level. This issue is limited to services used by the client (not the general-use JSON services) and requires reverse engineering of the proprietary serialization protocol, making it difficult to exploit.",
