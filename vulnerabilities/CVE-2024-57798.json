  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/dp_mst: Ensure mst_primary pointer is valid in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req()\n\nWhile receiving an MST up request message from one thread in\ndrm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), the MST topology could be removed from\nanother thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), freeing\nmst_primary and setting drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::mst_primary to NULL.\nThis could lead to a NULL deref/use-after-free of mst_primary in\ndrm_dp_mst_handle_up_req().\n\nAvoid the above by holding a reference for mst_primary in\ndrm_dp_mst_handle_up_req() while it's used.\n\nv2: Fix kfreeing the request if getting an mst_primary reference fails.",
