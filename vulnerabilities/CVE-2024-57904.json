  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: adc: at91: call input_free_device() on allocated iio_dev\n\nCurrent implementation of at91_ts_register() calls input_free_deivce()\non st->ts_input, however, the err label can be reached before the\nallocated iio_dev is stored to st->ts_input. Thus call\ninput_free_device() on input instead of st->ts_input.",
