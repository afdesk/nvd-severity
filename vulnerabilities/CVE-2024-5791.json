  "Description": "The Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'wp_id' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.2 due to missing authorization checks on processAction function, as well as insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
