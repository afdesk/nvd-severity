  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: dummy: iio_simply_dummy_buffer: fix information leak in triggered buffer\n\nThe 'data' array is allocated via kmalloc() and it is used to push data\nto user space from a triggered buffer, but it does not set values for\ninactive channels, as it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel()\nto assign new values.\n\nUse kzalloc for the memory allocation to avoid pushing uninitialized\ninformation to userspace.",
