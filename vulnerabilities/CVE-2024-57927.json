  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfs: Fix oops in nfs_netfs_init_request() when copying to cache\n\nWhen netfslib wants to copy some data that has just been read on behalf of\nnfs, it creates a new write request and calls nfs_netfs_init_request() to\ninitialise it, but with a NULL file pointer.  This causes\nnfs_file_open_context() to oops - however, we don't actually need the nfs\ncontext as we're only going to write to the cache.\n\nFix this by just returning if we aren't given a file pointer and emit a\nwarning if the request was for something other than copy-to-cache.\n\nFurther, fix nfs_netfs_free_request() so that it doesn't try to free the\ncontext if the pointer is NULL.",
