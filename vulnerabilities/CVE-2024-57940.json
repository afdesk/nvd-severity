  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: fix the infinite loop in exfat_readdir()\n\nIf the file system is corrupted so that a cluster is linked to\nitself in the cluster chain, and there is an unused directory\nentry in the cluster, 'dentry' will not be incremented, causing\ncondition 'dentry < max_dentries' unable to prevent an infinite\nloop.\n\nThis infinite loop causes s_lock not to be released, and other\ntasks will hang, such as exfat_sync_fs().\n\nThis commit stops traversing the cluster chain when there is unused\ndirectory entry in the cluster to avoid this infinite loop.",
