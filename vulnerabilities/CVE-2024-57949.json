  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()\n\nThe following call-chain leads to enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt\ndisabled section:\n\nirq_set_vcpu_affinity()\n  irq_get_desc_lock()\n     raw_spin_lock_irqsave()   <--- Disable interrupts\n  its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()\n     guard(raw_spinlock_irq)   <--- Enables interrupts when leaving the guard()\n  irq_put_desc_unlock()        <--- Warns because interrupts are enabled\n\nThis was broken in commit b97e8a2f7130, which replaced the original\nraw_spin_[un]lock() pair with guard(raw_spinlock_irq).\n\nFix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock).\n\n[ tglx: Massaged change log ]",
