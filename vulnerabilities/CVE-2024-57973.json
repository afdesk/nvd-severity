  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrdma/cxgb4: Prevent potential integer overflow on 32bit\n\nThe \"gl->tot_len\" variable is controlled by the user.  It comes from\nprocess_responses().  On 32bit systems, the \"gl->tot_len + sizeof(struct\ncpl_pass_accept_req) + sizeof(struct rss_header)\" addition could have an\ninteger wrapping bug.  Use size_add() to prevent this.",
