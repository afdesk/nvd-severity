  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: imx-jpeg: Fix potential error pointer dereference in detach_pm()\n\nThe proble is on the first line:\n\n\tif (jpeg->pd_dev[i] && !pm_runtime_suspended(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))\n\nIf jpeg->pd_dev[i] is an error pointer, then passing it to\npm_runtime_suspended() will lead to an Oops.  The other conditions\ncheck for both error pointers and NULL, but it would be more clear to\nuse the IS_ERR_OR_NULL() check for that.",
