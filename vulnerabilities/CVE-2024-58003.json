  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: i2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix extra fwnode_handle_put()\n\nThe ub913 and ub953 drivers call fwnode_handle_put(priv->sd.fwnode) as\npart of their remove process, and if the driver is removed multiple\ntimes, eventually leads to put \"overflow\", possibly causing memory\ncorruption or crash.\n\nThe fwnode_handle_put() is a leftover from commit 905f88ccebb1 (\"media:\ni2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix sub-device matching\"), which changed the code\nrelated to the sd.fwnode, but missed removing these fwnode_handle_put()\ncalls.",
