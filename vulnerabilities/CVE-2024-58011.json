  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: int3472: Check for adev == NULL\n\nNot all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might be NULL. This\ncan e.g. (theoretically) happen when a user manually binds one of\nthe int3472 drivers to another i2c/platform device through sysfs.\n\nAdd a check for adev not being set and return -ENODEV in that case to\navoid a possible NULL pointer deref in skl_int3472_get_acpi_buffer().",
