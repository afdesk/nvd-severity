  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nprintk: Fix signed integer overflow when defining LOG_BUF_LEN_MAX\n\nShifting 1 << 31 on a 32-bit int causes signed integer overflow, which\nleads to undefined behavior. To prevent this, cast 1 to u32 before\nperforming the shift, ensuring well-defined behavior.\n\nThis change explicitly avoids any potential overflow by ensuring that\nthe shift occurs on an unsigned 32-bit integer.",
