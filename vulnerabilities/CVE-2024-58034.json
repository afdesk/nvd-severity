  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmemory: tegra20-emc: fix an OF node reference bug in tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code()\n\nAs of_find_node_by_name() release the reference of the argument device\nnode, tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code() releases some device nodes while\nstill in use, resulting in possible UAFs. According to the bindings and\nthe in-tree DTS files, the \"emc-tables\" node is always device's child\nnode with the property \"nvidia,use-ram-code\", and the \"lpddr2\" node is a\nchild of the \"emc-tables\" node. Thus utilize the\nfor_each_child_of_node() macro and of_get_child_by_name() instead of\nof_find_node_by_name() to simplify the code.\n\nThis bug was found by an experimental verification tool that I am\ndeveloping.\n\n[krzysztof: applied v1, adjust the commit msg to incorporate v2 parts]",
