  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtlwifi: fix memory leaks and invalid access at probe error path\n\nDeinitialize at reverse order when probe fails.\n\nWhen init_sw_vars fails, rtl_deinit_core should not be called, specially\nnow that it destroys the rtl_wq workqueue.\n\nAnd call rtl_pci_deinit and deinit_sw_vars, otherwise, memory will be\nleaked.\n\nRemove pci_set_drvdata call as it will already be cleaned up by the core\ndriver code and could lead to memory leaks too. cf. commit 8d450935ae7f\n(\"wireless: rtlwifi: remove unnecessary pci_set_drvdata()\") and\ncommit 3d86b93064c7 (\"rtlwifi: Fix PCI probe error path orphaned memory\").",
