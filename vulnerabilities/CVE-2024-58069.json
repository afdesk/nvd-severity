  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtc: pcf85063: fix potential OOB write in PCF85063 NVMEM read\n\nThe nvmem interface supports variable buffer sizes, while the regmap\ninterface operates with fixed-size storage. If an nvmem client uses a\nbuffer size less than 4 bytes, regmap_read will write out of bounds\nas it expects the buffer to point at an unsigned int.\n\nFix this by using an intermediary unsigned int to hold the value.",
