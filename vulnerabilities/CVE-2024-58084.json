  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: qcom: scm: Fix missing read barrier in qcom_scm_get_tzmem_pool()\n\nCommit 2e4955167ec5 (\"firmware: qcom: scm: Fix __scm and waitq\ncompletion variable initialization\") introduced a write barrier in probe\nfunction to store global '__scm' variable.  We all known barriers are\npaired (see memory-barriers.txt: \"Note that write barriers should\nnormally be paired with read or address-dependency barriers\"), therefore\naccessing it from concurrent contexts requires read barrier.  Previous\ncommit added such barrier in qcom_scm_is_available(), so let's use that\ndirectly.\n\nLack of this read barrier can result in fetching stale '__scm' variable\nvalue, NULL, and dereferencing it.\n\nNote that barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() satisfies here the control\ndependency.",
