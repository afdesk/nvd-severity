  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: add check read-only before truncation in jfs_truncate_nolock()\n\nAdded a check for \"read-only\" mode in the `jfs_truncate_nolock`\nfunction to avoid errors related to writing to a read-only\nfilesystem.\n\nCall stack:\n\nblock_write_begin() {\n  jfs_write_failed() {\n    jfs_truncate() {\n      jfs_truncate_nolock() {\n        txEnd() {\n          ...\n          log = JFS_SBI(tblk->sb)->log;\n          // (log == NULL)\n\nIf the `isReadOnly(ip)` condition is triggered in\n`jfs_truncate_nolock`, the function execution will stop, and no\nfurther data modification will occur. Instead, the `xtTruncate`\nfunction will be called with the \"COMMIT_WMAP\" flag, preventing\nmodifications in \"read-only\" mode.",
