  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: add check read-only before txBeginAnon() call\n\nAdded a read-only check before calling `txBeginAnon` in `extAlloc`\nand `extRecord`. This prevents modification attempts on a read-only\nmounted filesystem, avoiding potential errors or crashes.\n\nCall trace:\n txBeginAnon+0xac/0x154\n extAlloc+0xe8/0xdec fs/jfs/jfs_extent.c:78\n jfs_get_block+0x340/0xb98 fs/jfs/inode.c:248\n __block_write_begin_int+0x580/0x166c fs/buffer.c:2128\n __block_write_begin fs/buffer.c:2177 [inline]\n block_write_begin+0x98/0x11c fs/buffer.c:2236\n jfs_write_begin+0x44/0x88 fs/jfs/inode.c:299",
