  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: stop recv() if initial process_rx_list gave us non-DATA\n\nIf we have a non-DATA record on the rx_list and another record of the\nsame type still on the queue, we will end up merging them:\n - process_rx_list copies the non-DATA record\n - we start the loop and process the first available record since it's\n   of the same type\n - we break out of the loop since the record was not DATA\n\nJust check the record type and jump to the end in case process_rx_list\ndid some work.",
