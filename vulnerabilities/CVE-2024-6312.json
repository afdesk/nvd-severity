  "Description": "The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.2 via the 'af2DeleteFontFile' function. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible.",
