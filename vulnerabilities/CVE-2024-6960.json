  "Description": "The H2O machine learning platform uses \"Iced\" classes as the primary means of moving Java Objects around the cluster. The Iced format supports inclusion of serialized Java objects. When a model is deserialized, any class is allowed to be deserialized (no class whitelist). An attacker can construct a crafted Iced model that uses Java gadgets and leads to arbitrary code execution when imported to the H2O platform.",
