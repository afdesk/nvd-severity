  "Description": "Amin Aliakbari, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found a broken access control which would lead to less-privileged operator- and/or viewer accounts having more privileges than designed. The risk of exploitation is very low as it requires complex steps to execute, including knowing of account passwords and social engineering attacks in tricking the administrator to perform specific configurations on operator- and/or viewer-privileged accounts. \nAxis has released patched AXIS OS a version for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution.",
