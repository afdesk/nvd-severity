  "Description": "A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Settings page of parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.8. The vulnerability is due to the improper use of the 'v-html' directive, which inserts the content of the 'full_template' variable directly as HTML. This allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code by injecting a payload into the 'System Template' input field under main configurations.",
