  "Description": "A heap buffer overflow was found in the virtio-snd device in QEMU. When reading input audio in the virtio-snd input callback, virtio_snd_pcm_in_cb, the function did not check whether the iov can fit the data buffer. This issue can trigger an out-of-bounds write if the size of the virtio queue element is equal to virtio_snd_pcm_status, which makes the available space for audio data zero.",
