  "Description": "A deserialization vulnerability exists in the Pytorch RPC framework (torch.distributed.rpc) in pytorch/pytorch versions <=2.3.1. The vulnerability arises from the lack of security verification during the deserialization process of PythonUDF objects in pytorch/torch/distributed/rpc/internal.py. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely by sending a malicious serialized PythonUDF object, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the master node.",
