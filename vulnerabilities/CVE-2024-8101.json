  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Text Explorer component of aimhubio/aim version 3.23.0. The vulnerability arises due to the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution when rendering tracked texts. This can be exploited by injecting malicious HTML content during the training process, which is then rendered unsanitized in the Text Explorer.",
