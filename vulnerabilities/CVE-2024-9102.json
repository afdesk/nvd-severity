  "Description": "phpLDAPadmin since at least version 1.2.0 through the latest version 1.2.6.7 allows users to export elements from the LDAP directory into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product. Thus, this could lead to CSV Formula Injection. NOTE: This vulnerability will not be addressed, the maintainer's position is that it is not the intention of phpLDAPadmin to control what data Administrators can put in their LDAP database, nor filter it on export.",
