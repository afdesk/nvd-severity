  "Description": "The Forminator Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.35.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the quiz 'create_module' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create draft quizzes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
