  "Description": "Slim Select 2.0 versions through 2.9.0 are affected by a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability. In select.ts:createOption(), the text variable from the user-provided Options object is assigned to an innerHTML without sanitation. Software that depends on this library to dynamically generate lists using unsanitized user-provided input may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting, resulting in attacker executed JavaScript. At this time, no patch is available.",
