  "Description": "A privilege escalation (PE) vulnerability in the XML API of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables an authenticated PAN-OS administrator with restricted privileges to use a compromised XML API key to perform actions as a higher privileged PAN-OS administrator. For example, an administrator with \"Virtual system administrator (read-only)\" access could use an XML API key of a \"Virtual system administrator\" to perform write operations on the virtual system configuration even though they should be limited to read-only operations.",
