  "Description": "A null pointer dereference in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software on PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series hardware platforms when Decryption policy is enabled allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS by sending specific traffic through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode.\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks VM-Series, Cloud NGFW, and Prisma Access are not affected.\n\n\nThis issue only affects PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series running these specific versions of PAN-OS:\n\n  *  10.2.7-h12\n  *  10.2.8-h10\n  *  10.2.9-h9\n  *  10.2.9-h11\n  *  10.2.10-h2\n  *  10.2.10-h3\n  *  10.2.11\n  *  10.2.11-h1\n  *  10.2.11-h2\n  *  10.2.11-h3\n  *  11.1.2-h9\n  *  11.1.2-h12\n  *  11.1.3-h2\n  *  11.1.3-h4\n  *  11.1.3-h6\n  *  11.2.2\n  *  11.2.2-h1",
