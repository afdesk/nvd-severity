  "Description": "The EventPrime \u2013 Events Calendar, Bookings and Tickets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via ticket names in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when front-end users can submit new events with tickets.",
