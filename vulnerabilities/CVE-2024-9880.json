  "Description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the `pandas.DataFrame.query` function of pandas-dev/pandas versions up to and including v2.2.2. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server by crafting a malicious query. The issue arises from the improper validation of user-supplied input in the `query` function when using the 'python' engine, leading to potential remote command execution.",
