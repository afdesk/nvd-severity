  "Description": "The WP Directorybox Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to incorrect authentication in the 'wp_dp_enquiry_agent_contact_form_submit_callback' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.",
