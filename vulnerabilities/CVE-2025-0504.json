  "Description": "Black Duck SCA versions prior to 2025.10.0 had user role permissions configured in an overly broad manner. Users with the scoped Project Manager user role with the Global User Read access permission enabled access to certain Project Administrator functionalities which should have be inaccessible. Exploitation does not grant full system control, but it may enable unauthorized changes to project configurations or access to system sensitive information.",
