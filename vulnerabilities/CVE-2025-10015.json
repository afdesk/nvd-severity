  "Description": "The Sparkle framework\u00a0includes an XPC service Downloader.xpc, by default this service is private to the application its bundled with. A local unprivileged attacker can register this XPC service globally which will inherit TCC permissions of the application. \nLack of validation of connecting client allows the attacker to\u00a0copy TCC-protected files to an arbitrary location.\u00a0Access to other resources beyond granted-permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.\n\nThis issue was fixed in version 2.7.2",
