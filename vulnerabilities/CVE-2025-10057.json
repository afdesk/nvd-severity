  "Description": "The WP Import \u2013 Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 7.28. This is due to the write_to_customfile() function writing unfiltered PHP code to a file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject the customFunction.php file with PHP code that can be accessed to trigger remote code execution.",
