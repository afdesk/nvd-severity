  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM\u00a05.13.0 and prior\u00a0that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a time-based blind SQL Injection\u00a0vulnerability in the EditEventTypes\u00a0functionality. The newCountName\u00a0parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.",
