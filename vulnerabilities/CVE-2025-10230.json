  "Description": "A flaw was found in Samba, in the front-end WINS hook handling: NetBIOS names from registration packets are passed to a shell without proper validation or escaping. Unsanitized NetBIOS name data from WINS registration packets are inserted into a shell command and executed by the Samba Active Directory Domain Controller\u2019s wins hook, allowing an unauthenticated network attacker to achieve remote command execution as the Samba process.",
