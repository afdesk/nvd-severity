  "Description": "The Contest Gallery \u2013 Upload, Vote & Sell with PayPal and Stripe plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple form field parameters in all versions up to, and including, 27.0.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access or higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
