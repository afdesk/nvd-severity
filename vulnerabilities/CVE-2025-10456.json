{
  "Description": "A vulnerability was identified in the handling of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fixed channels (such as SMP or ATT). Specifically, an attacker could exploit a flaw that causes the BLE target (i.e., the device under attack) to attempt to disconnect a fixed channel, which is not allowed per the Bluetooth specification. This leads to undefined behavior, including potential assertion failures, crashes, or memory corruption, depending on the BLE stack implementation.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM",
