  "Description": "iMonitor EAM 9.6394 installs a system service (eamusbsrv64.exe) that runs with NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges. This service includes an insecure update mechanism that automatically loads files placed in the C:\\sysupdate\\ directory during startup. Because any local user can create and write to this directory, an attacker can place malicious DLLs or executables in it. Upon service restart, the files are moved to the application\u2019s installation path and executed with SYSTEM privileges, leading to privilege escalation.",
