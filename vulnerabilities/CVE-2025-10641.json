  "Description": "All WorkExaminer Professional traffic between monitoring client, console and server is transmitted as plain text. This allows an attacker with access to the network to read the transmitted sensitive data. An attacker can also freely modify the data on the wire. The monitoring clients transmit their data to the server using the unencrypted FTP. Clients connect to the FTP server on port 12304 and transmit the data unencrypted. In addition, all traffic between the console client and the server at port 12306 is unencrypted.",
