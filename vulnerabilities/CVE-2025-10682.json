  "Description": "The TARIFFUXX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to insufficient neutralization of user-supplied input used directly in SQL queries. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject additional SQL into queries and extract sensitive information from the database via a crafted id attribute in the 'tariffuxx_configurator' shortcode.",
