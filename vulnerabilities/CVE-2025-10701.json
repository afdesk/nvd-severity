  "Description": "The Time Clock \u2013 A WordPress Employee & Volunteer Time Clock Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'data' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Time Clock user credentials to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an affected page.",
