  "Description": "The Classified Pro theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check in the 'cwp_addons_update_plugin_cb' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.14. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Note: The required nonce for the vulnerability is in the CubeWP Framework plugin.",
