  "Description": "The SureForms \u2013 Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.1. This is due to improper access control implementation on the '/wp-json/sureforms/v1/srfm-global-settings' REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive information including API keys for Google reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare Turnstile, hCaptcha, admin email addresses, and security-related form settings.",
