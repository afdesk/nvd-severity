  "Description": "The Microsoft Azure Storage for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized Arbitrary Media Deletion in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.1. This is due to missing capability checks on the 'azure-storage-media-replace' AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to delete arbitrary media files from the WordPress Media Library via the replace_attachment parameter granted they can access the nonce which is exposed to all authenticated users.",
