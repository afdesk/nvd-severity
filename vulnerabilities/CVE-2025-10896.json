  "Description": "Multiple plugins for WordPress with the Jewel Theme Recommended Plugins Library are vulnerable to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type via arbitrary plugin installation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2.3. This is due to missing capability checks on the '*_recommended_upgrade_plugin' function which allows arbitrary plugin URLs to be installed. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to upload arbitrary plugin packages to the affected site's server via a crafted plugin URL, which may make remote code execution possible.",
