  "Description": "The CE21 Suite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1 via the log file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including authentication credentials, which can be used to log in as other users as long as they have used the plugin's custom authentication feature before. This may include administrators, which makes a complete site takeover possible.",
