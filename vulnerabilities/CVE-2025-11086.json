  "Description": "The Academy LMS \u2013 WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's role prior to registering a user via the Social Login addon. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update their role to Administrator when registering on the site.",
