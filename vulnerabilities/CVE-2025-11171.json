  "Description": "The Chartify \u2013 WordPress Chart Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authentication for Critical Function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.9. This is due to the plugin registering an unauthenticated AJAX action that dispatches to admin-class methods based on a request parameter, without any nonce or capability checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute administrative functions via the wp-admin/admin-ajax.php endpoint granted they can identify callable method names.",
