  "Description": "The Document Library Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to the plugin exposing an unauthenticated AJAX action dll_load_posts which returns a JSON table of document data without performing nonce or capability checks. The handler accepts an attacker-controlled args array where the status option explicitly allows draft, pending, future, and any. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve unpublished document titles and content via the AJAX endpoint.",
