  "Description": "The RegistrationMagic \u2013 Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.6.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. An unauthenticated attacker could utilize an injected Cross-Site Scripting via user-agent on form submission to leverage this to achieve Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.",
