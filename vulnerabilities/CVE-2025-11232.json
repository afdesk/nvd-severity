  "Description": "To trigger the issue, three configuration parameters must have specific settings: \"hostname-char-set\" must be left at the default setting, which is \"[^A-Za-z0-9.-]\"; \"hostname-char-replacement\" must be empty (the default); and \"ddns-qualifying-suffix\" must *NOT* be empty (the default is empty). DDNS updates do not need to be enabled for this issue to manifest. A client that sends certain option content would then cause kea-dhcp4 to exit unexpectedly.\nThis issue affects Kea versions 3.0.1 through 3.0.1 and 3.1.1 through 3.1.2.",
