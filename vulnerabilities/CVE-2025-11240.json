  "Description": "An open redirect vulnerability existed in KNIME Business Hub prior to version 1.16.0. An unauthenticated remote attacker could craft a link to a legitimate KNIME Business Hub installation which, when opened by the user, redirects the user to a page of the attackers choice. This might open the possibility for fishing or other similar attacks. The problem has been fixed in KNIME Business Hub 1.16.0.",
