  "Description": "The VK All in One Expansion Unit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'vkExUnit_cta_url' and 'vkExUnit_cta_button_text' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 9.112.1. This is due to a logic error in the CTA save function that reads sanitization callbacks from the wrong variable ($custom_field_name instead of $custom_field_options), causing the sanitization to never be applied. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute when a user accesses an injected page.\",",
