  "Description": "The VK All in One Expansion Unit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the '_veu_custom_css' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 9.112.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the user-supplied Custom CSS value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
