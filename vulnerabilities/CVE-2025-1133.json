  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM 5.13.0 and prior\u00a0that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by exploiting a boolean-based blind SQL Injection\u00a0vulnerability in the EditEventAttendees\u00a0functionality. The EID\u00a0parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks. An attacker can manipulate the query, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.\u00a0 Please note that this vulnerability requires Administrator privileges.",
