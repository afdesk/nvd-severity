  "Description": "The LearnPress \u2013 WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to modification of data in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.9.2. This is due to missing capability checks on the Admin Tools REST endpoints which are registered with permission_callback set to __return_true. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform destructive database operations including dropping indexes on any table (including WordPress core tables like wp_options), creating duplicate configuration entries, and degrading site performance via the /wp-json/lp/v1/admin/tools/create-indexs endpoint granted they can provide table names.",
