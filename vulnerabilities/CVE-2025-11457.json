  "Description": "The EasyCommerce \u2013 AI-Powered, Fast & Beautiful WordPress Ecommerce Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in versions 0.9.0-beta2 to 1.5.0. This is due to the /easycommerce/v1/orders REST API endpoint not properly restricting the ability for users to select roles during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain administrator-level access to a vulnerable site.",
