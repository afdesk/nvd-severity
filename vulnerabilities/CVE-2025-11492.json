  "Description": "In the ConnectWise Automate Agent, communications could be configured to use HTTP instead of HTTPS. In such cases, an on-path threat actor with a man-in-the-middle network position could intercept, modify, or replay agent-server traffic. Additionally, the encryption method used to obfuscate some communications over the HTTP channel is updated in the Automate 2025.9 patch to enforce HTTPS for all agent communications.",
