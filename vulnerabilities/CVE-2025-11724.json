  "Description": "The EM Beer Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload leading to remote code execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to missing file type validation in the EMBM_Admin_Untappd_Import_image() function and missing authorization checks on the wp_ajax_embm-untappd-import action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files including PHP files and execute code on the server granted they can provide a mock HTTP server that responds with specific JSON data.",
