  "Description": "The All in One Time Clock Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing authorization check in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.3. This is due  to the plugin exposing admin-level AJAX actions to unauthenticated users via wp_ajax_nopriv_ hooks, while relying only on a nonce check without capability checks. This makes it possible for  unauthenticated attackers to create published pages, create shift records with integrity issues, and download time reports containing PII (employee names and work schedules).",
