  "Description": "The eRoom \u2013 Webinar & Meeting Plugin for Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to exposure of sensitive information in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This is due to the plugin exposing Zoom SDK secret keys in client-side JavaScript within the meeting view template. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract the sdk_secret value, which should remain server-side, compromising the security of the Zoom integration and allowing attackers to generate valid JWT signatures for unauthorized meeting access.",
