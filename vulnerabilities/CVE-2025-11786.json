  "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Circutor SGE-PLC1000/SGE-PLC50 v9.0.2. In the 'SetUserPassword()' function, the 'newPassword' parameter is directly embedded in a shell command string using 'sprintf()' without any sanitisation or validation, and then executed using 'system()'. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed with the same privileges as the application.",
