  "Description": "The Simple Business Data plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'simple_business_data' shortcode attributes in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly sanitizing user input or escaping output when embedding the `type` attribute into the `class` attribute in rendered HTML. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
