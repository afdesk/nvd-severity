  "Description": "The Crypto Payment Gateway with Payeer for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to payment bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a payments status through server-side validation though the /wc-api/bp-payeer-gateway-callback endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update unpaid order statuses to paid resulting in a loss of revenue.",
