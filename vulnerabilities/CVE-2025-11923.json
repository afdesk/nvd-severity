  "Description": "The LifterLMS \u2013 WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to allowing them to modify their own role via the REST API. The permission check in the update_item_permissions_check() function returns true when a user updates their own account without verifying the role changes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with student-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to administrator by updating their own roles array via a crafted REST API request. Another endpoint intended for instructors also provides an attack vector. Affected version ranges are 3.5.3-3.41.2, 4.0.0-4.21.3, 5.0.0-5.10.0, 6.0.0-6.11.0, 7.0.0-7.8.7, 8.0.0-8.0.7, 9.0.0-9.0.7, 9.1.0.",
