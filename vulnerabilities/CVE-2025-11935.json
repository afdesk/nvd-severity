  "Description": "With TLS 1.3 pre-shared key (PSK) a malicious or faulty server could ignore the request for PFS (perfect forward secrecy) and the client would continue on with the connection using PSK without PFS. This happened when a\u00a0server responded to a ClientHello containing psk_dhe_ke without a key_share extension.\u00a0The re-use of an authenticated PSK connection that on the clients side unexpectedly did not have PFS, reduces the security of the connection.",
