  "Description": "In Eclipse Vert.x versions [4.0.0, 4.5.21] and [5.0.0, 5.0.4], when \"directory listing\" is enabled, file and directory names are inserted into generated HTML without proper escaping in the href, title, and link attributes. An attacker who can create or rename files or directories within a served path can craft filenames containing malicious script or HTML content, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) that executes in the context of users viewing the affected directory listing.",
