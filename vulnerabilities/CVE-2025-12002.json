  "Description": "The Feeds for YouTube Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.0 via the 'sby_check_wp_submit' AJAX action. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data and the use of that data in a file operation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information, granted the 'Save Featured Images' setting is enabled and 'Disable WP Posts' is disabled. Note: This vulnerability only affects the Pro version of Feeds for YouTube.",
