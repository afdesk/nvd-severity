  "Description": "The ViaAds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the `ViaAds_pluginHandler` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's API key and cookie consent settings via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
