  "Description": "A flaw was found in Red Hat Openshift AI Service. The TrustyAI component is granting all service accounts and users on a cluster permissions to  get, list, watch any pod in any namespace on the cluster.\n\nTrustyAI is creating a role `trustyai-service-operator-lmeval-user-role` and a CRB `trustyai-service-operator-default-lmeval-user-rolebinding` which is being applied to `system:authenticated` making it so that every single user or service account can get a list of pods running in any namespace on the cluster \n\nAdditionally users can access all `persistentvolumeclaims` and `lmevaljobs`",
