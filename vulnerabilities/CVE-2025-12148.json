  "Description": "In Search Guard versions 3.1.1 and earlier, Field Masking (FM) rules are improperly enforced on fields of type IP (IP Address).\n\nWhile the content of these fields is properly redacted in the _source document returned by search operations, the results do return documents (hits) when searching based on a specific IP values. This allows to reconstruct the original contents of the field.\n\nWorkaround -\u00a0If you cannot upgrade immediately, you can avoid the problem by using field level security (FLS) protection on fields of the affected types instead of field masking.",
