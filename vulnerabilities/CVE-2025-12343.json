  "Description": "A flaw was found in FFmpeg\u2019s TensorFlow backend within the libavfilter/dnn_backend_tf.c source file. The issue occurs in the dnn_execute_model_tf() function, where a task object is freed multiple times in certain error-handling paths. This redundant memory deallocation can lead to a double-free condition, potentially causing FFmpeg or any application using it to crash when processing TensorFlow-based DNN models. This results in a denial-of-service scenario but does not allow arbitrary code execution under normal conditions.",
