This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive information including user IDs, display names, and email addresses of all users on the site via the get_bank_accounts AJAX action.
