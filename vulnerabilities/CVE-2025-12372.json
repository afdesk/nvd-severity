  "Description": "The Permalinks Cascade plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the handleTPCAdminAjaxRequest function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform unauthorized administrative actions such as enabling or disabling automatic pinging settings and modifying page exclusion settings.",
