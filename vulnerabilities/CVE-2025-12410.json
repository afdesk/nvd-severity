This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the sh_contextual_help_dashboard_widget() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
