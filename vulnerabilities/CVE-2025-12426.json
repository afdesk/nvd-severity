  "Description": "The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.0.80. This is due to the plugin exposing quiz answers through the ays_quiz_check_answer AJAX action without proper authorization checks. The endpoint only validates a nonce, but that same nonce is publicly available to all site visitors via the quiz_maker_ajax_public localized script data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including quiz answers for any quiz question.",
