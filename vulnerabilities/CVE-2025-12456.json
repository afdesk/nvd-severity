  "Description": "The Centangle-Team plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Additionally, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on cai_name_color parameter, this issue allows to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages, that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
