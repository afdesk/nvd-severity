  "Description": "The Widgets for Google Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 13.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on Google Reviews data imported by the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in the admin panel (and potentially on the frontend) whenever a user accesses imported reviews, granted they can add a malicious review to a Google Place that is connected to the vulnerable site.",
