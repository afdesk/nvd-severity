  "Description": "The Conditional Maintenance Mode for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce validation when toggling the maintenance mode status. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable the site's maintenance mode via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
