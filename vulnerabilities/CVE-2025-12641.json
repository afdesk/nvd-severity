  "Description": "The Awesome Support - WordPress HelpDesk & Support Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks in all versions up to, and including, 6.3.6. This is due to the 'wpas_do_mr_activate_user' function not verifying that a user has permission to modify other users' roles, combined with a nonce reuse vulnerability where public registration nonces are valid for privileged actions because all actions share the same nonce namespace. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to demote administrators to low-privilege roles via the 'wpas-do=mr_activate_user' action with a user-controlled 'user_id' parameter, granted they can access the publicly available registration/submit ticket page to extract a valid nonce.",
