  "Description": "The Quick Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Mail Relay in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.6. This is due to the 'qcf_validate_form' AJAX endpoint allowing a user controlled parameter to set the 'from' email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails to arbitrary recipients utilizing the server. The information is limited to the contact form submission details.",
