  "Description": "The Import any XML, CSV or Excel File to WordPress (WP All Import) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.6. This is due to the use of eval() on unsanitized user-supplied input in the pmxi_if function within helpers/functions.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with import capabilities (typically administrators), to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server via crafted import templates. This can lead to remote code execution.",
