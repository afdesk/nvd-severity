  "Description": "Improper handling of the authentication token in the Amazon WorkSpaces client for Linux, versions 2023.0 through 2024.8, may expose the authentication token for DCV-based WorkSpaces to other local users on the same client machine. Under certain circumstances, a local user may be able to extract another local user's authentication token from the shared client machine and access their WorkSpace.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, users should upgrade to the Amazon WorkSpaces client for Linux version 2025.0 or later.",
