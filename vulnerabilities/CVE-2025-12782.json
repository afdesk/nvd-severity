  "Description": "The Beaver Builder \u2013 WordPress Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's authorization in the disable() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to disable the Beaver Builder layout on arbitrary posts and pages, causing content integrity issues and layout disruption on those pages.",
