  "Description": "The Tablesome Table \u2013 Contact Form DB \u2013 WPForms, CF7, Gravity, Forminator, Fluent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data that leads to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the get_table_data() function in versions 0.5.4 to 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve plugin table data that can expose email log information. Attackers can leverage this on sites where the table log is enabled in order to trigger a password reset and obtain the reset key.",
