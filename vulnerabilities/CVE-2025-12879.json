  "Description": "The User Generator and Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to and including 1.2.2. This is due to missing nonce validation in the \"Import Using CSV File\" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate user privileges by creating arbitrary accounts with administrator privileges via a forged request, provided they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
