  "Description": "The Post SMTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to update OAuth tokens on the 'handle_gmail_oauth_redirect' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to inject invalid or attacker-controlled OAuth credentials.",
