  "Description": "Vulnerability in X25519 constant-time cryptographic implementations due to timing side channels introduced by compiler optimizations and CPU architecture limitations, specifically with the Xtensa-based ESP32 chips. If targeting Xtensa it is recommended to use the low memory implementations of X25519, which is now turned on as the default for Xtensa.",
