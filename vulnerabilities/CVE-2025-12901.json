  "Description": "The Asgaros Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the set_subscription_level() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the subscription settings of authenticated users via a forged request granted they can trick a logged-in user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
