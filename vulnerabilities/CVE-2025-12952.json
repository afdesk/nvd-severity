  "Description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Google Cloud's Dialogflow CX.\n\nDialogflow agent developers with Webhook editor permission are able to configure Webhooks using Dialogflow service agent access token authentication. \nThis allows the attacker to escalate their privileges from agent-level to project-level, granting them unauthorized access to manage resources in services associated with the project, leading to\u00a0unexpected costs and resource depletion for the producer project.\n\nA fix was applied\u00a0on the server side\u00a0to protect from this vulnerability in February 2025. No\u00a0customer action is required.",
