  "Description": "The Magical Posts Display plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'mpac_title_tag' parameter in the Magical Posts Accordion widget in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.54 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied HTML tag names. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
