  "Description": "The Web Accessibility by accessiBe plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.11. This is due to the `accessibe_render_js_in_footer()` function logging the complete plugin options array to the browser console on public pages, without restricting output to privileged users or checking for debug mode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive configuration data, including email addresses, accessiBe user IDs, account IDs, and license information, via the browser console when the widget is disabled.",
