  "Description": "The SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.20. This is due to missing nonce validation on the SurveyJS_DeleteSurvey AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete surveys via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
