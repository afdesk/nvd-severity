  "Description": "The Poll, Survey & Quiz Maker Plugin by Opinion Stage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 19.12.0. This is due to missing or insufficient nonce validation on the disconnect_account_action function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disconnect the site from the Opinion Stage platform integration via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
