  "Description": "The Vitepos \u2013 Point of Sale (POS) for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the insert_media_attachment() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This is due to the save_update_category_img() function accepting user-supplied file types without validation when processing category images. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which makes remote code execution possible.",
