  "Description": "The Flo Forms \u2013 Easy Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.43. This is due to the plugin allowing SVG file uploads via an unauthenticated AJAX endpoint (`flo_form_submit`) without proper file content validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious SVG files containing JavaScript that executes when an administrator views the uploaded file in the WordPress admin interface, leading to potential full site compromise.",
