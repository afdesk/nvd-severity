  "Description": "The Booking Calendar Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.60. This is due to missing authorization checks and payment verification in the `dex_bccf_check_IPN_verification` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily confirm bookings and bypass payment requirements via the 'dex_bccf_ipn' parameter.",
