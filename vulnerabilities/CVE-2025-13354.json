  "Description": "The Tag, Category, and Taxonomy Manager \u2013 AI Autotagger with OpenAI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.40.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the \"taxopress_merge_terms_batch\" function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to merge or delete arbitrary taxonomy terms.",
