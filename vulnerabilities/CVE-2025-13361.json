  "Description": "The Web to SugarCRM Lead plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the custom field deletion functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete custom fields via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
