  "Description": "The Rabbit Hole plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the plugin's reset functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the reset operation is performed via a GET request, making exploitation trivial via image tags or hyperlinks.",
