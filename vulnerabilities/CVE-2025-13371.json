  "Description": "The MoneySpace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.9. This is due to the plugin storing full payment card details (PAN, card holder name, expiry month/year, and CVV) in WordPress post_meta using base64_encode(), and then embedding these values into the publicly accessible mspaylink page's inline JavaScript without any authentication or authorization check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know or can guess an order_id to access the mspaylink endpoint and retrieve full credit card numbers and CVV codes directly from the HTML/JS response, constituting a severe PCI-DSS violation.",
