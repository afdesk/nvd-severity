  "Description": "The 10Web Booster \u2013 Website speed optimization, Cache & Page Speed optimizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary folder deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the get_cache_dir_for_page_from_url() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.32.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary folders on the server, which can easily lead to a loss of data or a denial of service condition.",
