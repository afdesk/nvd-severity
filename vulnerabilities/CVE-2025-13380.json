  "Description": "The AI Engine for WordPress: ChatGPT, GPT Content Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied file paths in the 'lqdai_update_post' AJAX endpoint and the use of file_get_contents() with user-controlled URLs without protocol restrictions in the insert_image() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.",
