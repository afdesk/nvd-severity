  "Description": "The Job Board by BestWebSoft plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to the plugin storing the entire unsanitized `$_GET` superglobal array directly into the database via `update_user_meta()` when users save search results, and later outputting this data without proper escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute whenever a user accesses the saved search or views their profile, granted they can trick the user into performing the search and saving the results.",
