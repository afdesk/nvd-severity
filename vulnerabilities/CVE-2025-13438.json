  "Description": "The Page Title, Description & Open Graph Updater plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.02. This is due to missing nonce validation on multiple AJAX actions including dieno_update_page_title. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update page titles and metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
