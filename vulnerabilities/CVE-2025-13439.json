  "Description": "The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Disclosure and PHAR Deserialization in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the 'url' parameter of the 'fpd_custom_uplod_file' AJAX action, which flows directly into the 'getimagesize' function without sanitization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary sensitive files from the server, including wp-config.php.",
