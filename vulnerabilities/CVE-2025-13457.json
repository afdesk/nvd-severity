  "Description": "The WooCommerce Square plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.1 via the get_token_by_id  function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to expose arbitrary Square \"ccof\" (credit card on file) values and leverage this value to potentially make fraudulent charges on the target site.",
