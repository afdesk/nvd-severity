  "Description": "In RNP version 0.18.0 a refactoring regression causes the symmetric \nsession key used for Public-Key Encrypted Session Key (PKESK) packets to\n be left uninitialized except for zeroing, resulting in it always being \nan all-zero byte array.\n\nAny data encrypted using public-key encryption \nin this release can be decrypted trivially by supplying an all-zero \nsession key, fully compromising confidentiality.\n\nThe vulnerability affects only public key encryption (PKESK packets).\u00a0 Passphrase-based encryption (SKESK packets) is not affected.\n\nRoot cause: Vulnerable session key buffer used in PKESK packet generation.\n\n\n\nThe defect was introduced in commit `7bd9a8dc356aae756b40755be76d36205b6b161a` where initialization \nlogic inside `encrypted_build_skesk()` only randomized the key for the \nSKESK path and omitted it for the PKESK path.",
