  "Description": "The SSP Debug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to the plugin storing PHP error logs in a predictable, web-accessible location (wp-content/uploads/ssp-debug/ssp-debug.log) without any access controls. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive debugging information including full URLs, client IP addresses, User-Agent strings, WordPress user IDs, and internal filesystem paths.",
