  "Description": "A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability exists in the error handling component of ATISoluciones CIGES Application version 2.15.6 and earlier. When certain unexpected conditions trigger unhandled exceptions, the application returns detailed error messages and stack traces to the client. This may expose internal filesystem paths, SQL queries, database connection details, or environment configuration data to remote unauthenticated attackers. This issue allows information gathering and reconnaissance but does not enable direct system compromise.",
