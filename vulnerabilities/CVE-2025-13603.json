This is due to insufficient capability checks and lack of nonce verification on the \"wpag_htaccess_callback\" function This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the site's .htaccess file with arbitrary content, which can lead to arbitrary file read on the server under certain configurations.",
