  "Description": "The Modula Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'ajax_unzip_file' function in versions 2.13.1 to 2.13.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files with race condition on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
