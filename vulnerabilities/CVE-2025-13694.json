  "Description": "The AA Block Country plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin trusting user-supplied headers such as HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR to determine the client's IP address without proper validation or considering if the server is behind a trusted proxy. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass IP-based access restrictions by spoofing their IP address via the X-Forwarded-For header.",
