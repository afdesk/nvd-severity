  "Description": "The OpenID Connect Generic Client plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'openid_connect_generic_auth_url' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
