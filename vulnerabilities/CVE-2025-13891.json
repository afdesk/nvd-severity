  "Description": "The Image Gallery \u2013 Photo Grid & Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.3. This is due to the modula_list_folders AJAX endpoint that lacks proper path validation and base directory restrictions. While the endpoint verifies user capabilities (Author+ with upload_files and edit_posts permissions), it fails to validate that user-supplied directory paths reside within safe directories. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to enumerate arbitrary directories on the server via the modula_list_folders endpoint.",
