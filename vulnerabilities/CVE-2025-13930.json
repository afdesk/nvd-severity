  "Description": "The Checkout Field Manager (Checkout Manager) for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.8.5. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to delete an attachment combined with flawed guest order ownership validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete attachments associated with guest orders using only the publicly available wooccm_upload nonce and attachment ID.",
