  "Description": "The Reviews Sorted plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'space' parameter of the [reviews-slider] shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
