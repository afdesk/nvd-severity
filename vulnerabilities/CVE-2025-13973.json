  "Description": "The StickEasy Protected Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. The plugin stores spam detection logs at a predictable publicly accessible location (wp-content/uploads/stickeasy-protected-contact-form/spcf-log.txt). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download the log file and access sensitive information including visitor IP addresses, email addresses, and comment snippets from contact form submissions that were flagged as spam.",
