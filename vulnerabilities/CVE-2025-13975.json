  "Description": "The Contact Form 7 with ChatWork plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'api_token' and 'roomid' settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the settings page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
