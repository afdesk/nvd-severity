  "Description": "The Essential Addons for Elementor \u2013 Popular Elementor Templates & Widgets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple attack vectors in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.3. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Event Calendar widget's custom attributes handling and the Image Masking module's element ID rendering. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
