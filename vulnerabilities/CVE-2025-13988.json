  "Description": "The \u8bc4\u8bba\u5c0f\u79d8\u4e66 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable in the plugin's settings page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
