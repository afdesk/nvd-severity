  "Description": "The WC Builder \u2013 WooCommerce Page Builder for WPBakery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'heading_color' parameter (and multiple other styling parameters) of the `wpbforwpbakery_product_additional_information` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
