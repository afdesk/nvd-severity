  "Description": "The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This is due to the plugin exposing the 'hotel_booking_fetch_customer_info' AJAX action to unauthenticated users without proper capability checks, relying only on a nonce for protection. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve sensitive customer information including full names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses by providing a valid email address and a publicly accessible nonce.",
