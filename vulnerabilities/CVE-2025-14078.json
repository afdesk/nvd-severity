  "Description": "The PAYGENT for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.6. This is due to missing authorization checks on the paygent_check_webhook function combined with the paygent_permission_callback function unconditionally returning true on line 199. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate payment callbacks and modify order statuses by sending forged payment notifications via the `/wp-json/paygent/v1/check/` endpoint.",
