  "Description": "The Truefy Embed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'truefy_embed_options_update' settings update action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings, including the API key, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
