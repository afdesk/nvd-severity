  "Description": "The BMLT WordPress Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.11.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'BMLTPlugin_create_option' and 'BMLTPlugin_delete_option ' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
