  "Description": "The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.11.53. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'insert_inner_template' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary Elementor templates via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator or other user with the edit_posts capability into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
