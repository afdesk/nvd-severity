  "Description": "The WP DB Booster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the cleanup_all AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete database records including post drafts, revisions, comments, and metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
