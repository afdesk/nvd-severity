  "Description": "The OneClick Chat to Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the wa_order_number_save_number_field function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to modify WhatsApp phone numbers used by the plugin, redirecting customer orders and messages to attacker-controlled phone numbers.",
