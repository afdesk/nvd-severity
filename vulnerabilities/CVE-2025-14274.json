  "Description": "The Unlimited Elements for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Border Hero widget's Button Link field in versions up to 2.0.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
