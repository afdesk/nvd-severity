  "Description": "The Video Merchant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in version <= 5.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the video_merchant_add_video_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files that make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
