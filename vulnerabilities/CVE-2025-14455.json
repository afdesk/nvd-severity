  "Description": "The Image Photo Gallery Final Tiles Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform actions on gallery management functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete, modify, or clone galleries created by any user, including administrators.",
