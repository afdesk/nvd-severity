  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of the G\u00fcralp Fortimus Series, Minimus Series and Certimus Series allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to send specially-crafted HTTP requests that can cause the web service process to deliberately restart. Although this mechanism limits the impact of the attack, it results in a brief denial-of-service condition during the restart.",
