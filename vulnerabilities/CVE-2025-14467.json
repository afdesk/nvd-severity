  "Description": "The WP Job Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9. This is due to the plugin explicitly whitelisting the `<script>` tag in its `WPJOBPORTAL_ALLOWED_TAGS` configuration and using insufficient input sanitization when saving job descriptions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts into job description fields via the job creation/editing interface. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, enabling session hijacking, credential theft, and other malicious activities.This only impacts multi-site installations, or those with unfiltered_html disabled.",
