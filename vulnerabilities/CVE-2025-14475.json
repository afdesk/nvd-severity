  "Description": "The Extensive VC Addons for WPBakery page builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1 via the `extensive_vc_get_module_template_part` function. This is due to insufficient path normalization and validation of the user-supplied `shortcode_name` parameter in the `extensive_vc_init_shortcode_pagination` AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files via the `shortcode_name` parameter.",
