  "Description": "An overly-permissive IAM trust policy in the Harmonix on AWS framework may allow authenticated users to escalate privileges via role assumption. The sample code for the EKS environment provisioning role is configured to trust the account root principal, which may enable any account principal with sts:AssumeRole permissions to assume the role with administrative privileges. \n\nWe recommend customers upgrade to Harmonix on AWS v0.4.2 or later if you have deployed the framework using versions v0.3.0 through v0.4.1.",
