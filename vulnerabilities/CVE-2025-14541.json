  "Description": "The Lucky Wheel Giveaway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.22 via the conditional_tags parameter. This is due to the plugin using PHP's eval() function on user-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server.",
