  "Description": "In the Eclipse OMR compiler component, since release 0.7.0, an optimization enabled for Eclipse OpenJ9 consumers of OMR on Z processors incorrectly handles NUL (0x00) characters during the Latin-compatible charset (UTF-8, ISO8859-1, ASCII, etc) to IBM-1047/037 translation sequence. This can cause the output byte array to be truncated, discarding the first NUL byte and all subsequent characters, and thereby exposing a possible buffer over-read problem. This issue is fixed in Eclipse OMR version 0.8.0.",
