  "Description": "The WP Last Modified Info plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.5. This is due to the plugin not validating a user's access to a post before modifying its metadata in the 'bulk_save' AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to update the last modified metadata and lock the modification date of arbitrary posts, including those created by Administrators via the 'post_ids' parameter.",
