  "Description": "The Wise Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This is due to missing capability checks on the REST API endpoint '/wise-analytics/v1/report'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive analytics data including administrator usernames, login timestamps, visitor tracking information, and business intelligence data via the 'name' parameter granted they can send unauthenticated requests.",
