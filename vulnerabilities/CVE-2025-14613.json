  "Description": "The GetContentFromURL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to the plugin using wp_remote_get() instead of wp_safe_remote_get() to fetch content from a user-supplied URL in the 'url' parameter of the [gcfu] shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.",
