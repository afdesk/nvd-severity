  "Description": "The Recooty \u2013 Job Widget (Old Dashboard) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to missing nonce validation on the recooty_save_maybe() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the recooty_key option and inject malicious content into iframe src attributes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
