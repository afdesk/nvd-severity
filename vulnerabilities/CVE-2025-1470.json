  "Description": "In Eclipse OMR, from the initial contribution to version 0.4.0, some OMR internal port library and utilities consumers of z/OS atoe functions do not check their return values for NULL memory pointers or for memory allocation failures.  This can lead to NULL pointer dereference crashes.  Beginning in version 0.5.0, internal OMR consumers of atoe functions handle NULL return values and memory allocation failures correctly.",
