  "Description": "In deployments using the ScreenConnect\u2122 Certificate Signing Extension, encrypted configuration values including an Azure Key Vault-related key, could be returned to unauthenticated users through a client-facing endpoint under certain conditions. The values remained encrypted and securely stored at rest; however, an encrypted representation could be exposed in client responses. Updating the Certificate Signing Extension to version 1.0.12 or higher ensures configuration handling occurs exclusively on the server side, preventing encrypted values from being transmitted to or rendered by client-side components.",
