  "Description": "A flaw has been found in OFFIS DCMTK up to 3.6.9. The impacted element is the function DcmQueryRetrieveIndexDatabaseHandle::startFindRequest/DcmQueryRetrieveIndexDatabaseHandle::startMoveRequest in the library dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc of the component dcmqrscp. This manipulation causes null pointer dereference. The attack requires local access. Upgrading to version 3.7.0 is sufficient to resolve this issue. Patch name: ffb1a4a37d2c876e3feeb31df4930f2aed7fa030. You should upgrade the affected component.",
