  "Description": "The Wizit Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Order Cancellation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This is due to a lack of authentication and authorization checks in the 'handle_checkout_redirecturl_response' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to cancel arbitrary WooCommerce orders by sending a crafted request with a valid order ID.",
