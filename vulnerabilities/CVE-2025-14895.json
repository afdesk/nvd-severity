  "Description": "The PopupKit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to access the /popup/logs REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read and delete analytics data including device types, browser information, countries, referrer URLs, and campaign metrics.",
