  "Description": "The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `ajax_callback_create_bunny_stream_video`, `ajax_callback_get_bunny_stream_video`, and `ajax_callback_delete_bunny_stream_video` functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create and delete videos on the Bunny Stream CDN associated with the victim's account, provided they can obtain a valid nonce which is exposed in public player templates.",
