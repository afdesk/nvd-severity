  "Description": "The Gutenverse Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.2. This is due to the plugin's framework component adding SVG to the allowed MIME types via the upload_mimes filter without implementing any sanitization of SVG file contents. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload SVG files containing malicious JavaScript that executes when the file is viewed, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in victims' browsers.",
