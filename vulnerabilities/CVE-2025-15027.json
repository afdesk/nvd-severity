  "Description": "The JAY Login & Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.03. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to update arbitrary user meta through the 'jay_login_register_ajax_create_final_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.",
