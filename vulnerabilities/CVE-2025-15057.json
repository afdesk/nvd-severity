  "Description": "The SlimStat Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `fh` (fingerprint) parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.3. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the fingerprint value stored in the database. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrator views the Real-time Access Log report.",
