  "Description": "An SSR XSS exists in async hydration when attacker\u2011controlled keys are passed to hydratable. The key is embedded inside a <script> block without HTML\u2011safe escaping, allowing </script> to terminate the script and inject arbitrary JavaScript. This enables remote script execution in users' browsers, with potential for session theft and account compromise.\nThis issue affects Svelte: from 5.46.0 before 5.46.3.",
