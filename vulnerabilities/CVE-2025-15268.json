  "Description": "The Infility Global plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection via the 'infility_get_data' API action in all versions up to, and including, 2.14.46. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append - with certain server configurations - additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
