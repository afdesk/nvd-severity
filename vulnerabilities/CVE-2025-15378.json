  "Description": "The AJS Footnotes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'note_list_class' and 'popup_display_effect_in' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to missing authorization and nonce verification on settings save, as well as insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
