  "Description": "The NotificationX \u2013 FOMO, Live Sales Notification, WooCommerce Sales Popup, GDPR, Social Proof, Announcement Banner & Floating Notification Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting via the 'nx-preview' POST parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when processing preview data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute when a user visits a malicious page that auto-submits a form to the vulnerable site.",
