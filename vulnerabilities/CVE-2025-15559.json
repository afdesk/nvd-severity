  "Description": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject OS commands when calling a server API endpoint in NesterSoft WorkTime. The server API call to generate and download the WorkTime client from the WorkTime server is vulnerable in the \u201cguid\u201d parameter.\u00a0This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the WorkTime server as NT Authority\\SYSTEM with the highest privileges. Attackers are able to access or manipulate sensitive data and take over the whole server.",
