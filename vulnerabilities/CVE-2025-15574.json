  "Description": "When connecting to the Solax Cloud MQTT server the username is the \"registration number\", which is the 10 character string printed on the SolaX Power Pocket device / the QR code on the device. The password is derived from the \"registration number\" using a proprietary XOR/transposition algorithm. Attackers with the knowledge of the registration numbers can connect to the MQTT server and impersonate the dongle / inverters.",
