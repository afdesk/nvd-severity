  "Description": "Crypt::Random Perl package 1.05 through 1.55 may use rand() function, which is not cryptographically strong, for cryptographic functions.\n\nCrypt::Random::rand 1.05 through 1.55 uses the rand() function.  If the Provider is not specified and /dev/urandom or an Entropy Gathering Daemon (egd) service is not available Crypt::Random will default to use the insecure Crypt::Random::rand provider.\n\nIn particular, Windows versions of perl will encounter this issue by default.",
