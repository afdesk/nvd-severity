  "Description": "The Page Builder: Pagelayer \u2013 Drag and Drop website builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the pagelayer_save_post function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify post contents via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
