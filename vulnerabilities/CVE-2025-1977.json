  "Description": "The NPort 6100-G2/6200-G2 Series is affected by an execution with unnecessary privileges vulnerability (CVE-2025-1977) that allows an authenticated user with read-only access to perform unauthorized configuration changes through the MCC (Moxa CLI Configuration) tool. The issue can be exploited remotely over the network with low-attack complexity and no user interaction but requires specific system conditions or configurations to be present. Successful exploitation may result in changes to device settings that were not intended to be permitted for the affected user role, potentially leading to a high impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device. No impact on other systems has been identified.",
