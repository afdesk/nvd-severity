  "Description": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\u00a0vulnerability has been identified in Psono-Client\u2019s handling of vault entries of type website_password and bookmark, as used in Bitdefender SecurePass. The client does not properly sanitize the URL field in these entries. As a result, an attacker can craft a malicious vault entry (or trick a user into creating or importing one) with a javascript:URL. When the user interacts with this entry (for example, by clicking or opening it), the application will execute the malicious JavaScript in the context of the Psono vault. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in the victim\u2019s browser, potentially giving them access to the user\u2019s password vault and sensitive data.",
