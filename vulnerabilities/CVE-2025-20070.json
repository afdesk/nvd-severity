  "Description": "Improper conditions check for the Intel(R) Optane(TM) PMem management software before versions CR_MGMT_02.00.00.4052, CR_MGMT_03.00.00.0538 within Ring 3: User Applications may allow an escalation of privilege. Unprivileged software adversary with an authenticated user combined with a high complexity attack may enable [cvss_threat_loss_factor]. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge and requires active user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (high) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.",
