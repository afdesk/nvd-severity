  "Description": "A vulnerability in the health monitoring diagnostics of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of specific Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained rate of crafted Ethernet frames to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.",
