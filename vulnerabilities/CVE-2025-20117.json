  "Description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco APIC could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root&nbsp;on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of an affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.",
