  "Description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3, 9.3.5, 9.2.7, and 9.1.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.104, 9.3.2408.113, and 9.2.2406.119, an unauthenticated attacker could send a specially-crafted SPL search command that could trigger a rolling restart in the Search Head Cluster through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS).<br><br>The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The attacker should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.<br><br>See [How rolling restart works](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.2/DistSearch/RestartSHC) for more information.",
