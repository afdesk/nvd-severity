  "Description": "A vulnerability in the directory permissions of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to the IP address of a device that has Web Access enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from the device.\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, Web Access must be enabled on the phone. Web Access is disabled by default.",
