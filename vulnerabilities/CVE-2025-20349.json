  "Description": "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Catalyst Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands in a restricted container as the root user.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in REST API request parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would then be executed in a restricted container with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Observer.",
