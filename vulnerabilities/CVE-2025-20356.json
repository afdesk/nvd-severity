  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Cyber Vision Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials that allow access to the Sensor Explorer page. By default, Admin and Product user roles have this access, as do any custom users that are configued to allow access to the Sensors page.",
