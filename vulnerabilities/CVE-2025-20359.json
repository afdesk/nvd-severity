  "Description": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort 3 HTTP Decoder that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the disclosure of possible sensitive data or cause the Snort 3 Detection Engine to crash.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an error in the logic of buffer handling when the MIME fields of the HTTP header are parsed. This can result in a buffer under-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an established connection that is parsed by Snort 3. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to induce one of two possible outcomes: the unexpected restarting of the Snort 3 Detection Engine, which could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, or information disclosure of sensitive information in the Snort 3 data stream. Due to the under-read condition, it is possible that sensitive information that is not valid connection data could be returned.",
