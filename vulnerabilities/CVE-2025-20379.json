  "Description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 10.0.1, 9.4.5, 9.3.7, and 9.2.9 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.116, 9.3.2408.124, 10.0.2503.5 and 10.1.2507.1, a low-privileged user that does not hold the \u201cadmin\u201c or \u201cpower\u201c Splunk roles could run a saved search with a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to bypass the SPL safeguards for risky commands. They could bypass these safeguards on the \u201c/services/streams/search\u201c endpoint through its \u201cq\u201c parameter by circumventing endpoint restrictions using character encoding in the REST path. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.",
