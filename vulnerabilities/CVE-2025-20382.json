  "Description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 10.0.2, 9.4.6, 9.3.8, and 9.2.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 10.1.2507.10, 10.0.2503.8, and 9.3.2411.120, a low-privileged user that does not hold the \"admin\" or \"power\" Splunk roles could create a views dashboard with a custom background using the `data:image/png;base64` protocol that could potentially lead to an unvalidated redirect. This behavior circumvents the Splunk external URL warning mechanism by using a specially crafted URL, allowing for a redirection to an external malicious site. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.",
