  "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker sending a specific BGP update packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). \n\nContinuous receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2;\u00a0\n\n\nThis issue does not affect versions prior to\u00a021.1R1.\n\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect versions prior to 21.1R1-EVO",
