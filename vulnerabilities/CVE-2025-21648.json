  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: conntrack: clamp maximum hashtable size to INT_MAX\n\nUse INT_MAX as maximum size for the conntrack hashtable. Otherwise, it\nis possible to hit WARN_ON_ONCE in __kvmalloc_node_noprof() when\nresizing hashtable because __GFP_NOWARN is unset. See:\n\n  0708a0afe291 (\"mm: Consider __GFP_NOWARN flag for oversized kvmalloc() calls\")\n\nNote: hashtable resize is only possible from init_netns.",
