  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/eventfd: ensure io_eventfd_signal() defers another RCU period\n\nio_eventfd_do_signal() is invoked from an RCU callback, but when\ndropping the reference to the io_ev_fd, it calls io_eventfd_free()\ndirectly if the refcount drops to zero. This isn't correct, as any\npotential freeing of the io_ev_fd should be deferred another RCU grace\nperiod.\n\nJust call io_eventfd_put() rather than open-code the dec-and-test and\nfree, which will correctly defer it another RCU grace period.",
