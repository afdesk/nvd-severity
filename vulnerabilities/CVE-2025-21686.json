  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts\n\nWhen IORING_REGISTER_CLONE_BUFFERS is used to clone buffers from uring\ninstance A to uring instance B, where A and B use different MMs for\naccounting, the accounting can go wrong:\nIf uring instance A is closed before uring instance B, the pinned memory\ncounters for uring instance B will be decremented, even though the pinned\nmemory was originally accounted through uring instance A; so the MM of\nuring instance B can end up with negative locked memory.",
