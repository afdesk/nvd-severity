  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()\n\nThis patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to\nan incorrect bounds check in the following:\n\n       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {\n               dev_err(&port->dev,\n                       \"%s - port change to invalid port: %i\\n\",\n                       __func__, newport);\n               break;\n       }\n\nThe condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port\nbuffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal\nto serial->num_ports, the assignment of \"port\" in the\nfollowing code is out-of-bounds and NULL:\n\n       serial_priv->current_port = newport;\n       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];\n\nThe fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_ports\nindicating it is out-of-bounds.",
