  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetem: Update sch->q.qlen before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()\n\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() notifies parent qdisc only if child\nqdisc becomes empty, therefore we need to reduce the backlog of the\nchild qdisc before calling it. Otherwise it would miss the opportunity\nto call cops->qlen_notify(), in the case of DRR, it resulted in UAF\nsince DRR uses ->qlen_notify() to maintain its active list.",
