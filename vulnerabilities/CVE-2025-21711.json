  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/rose: prevent integer overflows in rose_setsockopt()\n\nIn case of possible unpredictably large arguments passed to\nrose_setsockopt() and multiplied by extra values on top of that,\ninteger overflows may occur.\n\nDo the safest minimum and fix these issues by checking the\ncontents of 'opt' and returning -EINVAL if they are too large. Also,\nswitch to unsigned int and remove useless check for negative 'opt'\nin ROSE_IDLE case.",
