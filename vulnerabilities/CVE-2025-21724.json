  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommufd/iova_bitmap: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()\n\nResolve a UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds issue in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()\nwhere shifting the constant \"1\" (of type int) by bitmap->mapped.pgshift\n(an unsigned long value) could result in undefined behavior.\n\nThe constant \"1\" defaults to a 32-bit \"int\", and when \"pgshift\" exceeds\n31 (e.g., pgshift = 63) the shift operation overflows, as the result\ncannot be represented in a 32-bit type.\n\nTo resolve this, the constant is updated to \"1UL\", promoting it to an\nunsigned long type to match the operand's type.",
