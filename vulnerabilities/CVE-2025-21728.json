  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Send signals asynchronously if !preemptible\n\nBPF programs can execute in all kinds of contexts and when a program\nrunning in a non-preemptible context uses the bpf_send_signal() kfunc,\nit will cause issues because this kfunc can sleep.\nChange `irqs_disabled()` to `!preemptible()`.",
