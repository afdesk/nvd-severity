  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix possible int overflows in nilfs_fiemap()\n\nSince nilfs_bmap_lookup_contig() in nilfs_fiemap() calculates its result\nby being prepared to go through potentially maxblocks == INT_MAX blocks,\nthe value in n may experience an overflow caused by left shift of blkbits.\n\nWhile it is extremely unlikely to occur, play it safe and cast right hand\nexpression to wider type to mitigate the issue.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static analysis\ntool SVACE.",
