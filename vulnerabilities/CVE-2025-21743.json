  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: ipheth: fix possible overflow in DPE length check\n\nOriginally, it was possible for the DPE length check to overflow if\nwDatagramIndex + wDatagramLength > U16_MAX. This could lead to an OoB\nread.\n\nMove the wDatagramIndex term to the other side of the inequality.\n\nAn existing condition ensures that wDatagramIndex < urb->actual_length.",
