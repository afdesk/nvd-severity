  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: Orphan socket after transport release\n\nDuring socket release, sock_orphan() is called without considering that it\nsets sk->sk_wq to NULL. Later, if SO_LINGER is enabled, this leads to a\nnull pointer dereferenced in virtio_transport_wait_close().\n\nOrphan the socket only after transport release.\n\nPartially reverts the 'Fixes:' commit.\n\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000018-0x000000000000001f]\n lock_acquire+0x19e/0x500\n _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x47/0x70\n add_wait_queue+0x46/0x230\n virtio_transport_release+0x4e7/0x7f0\n __vsock_release+0xfd/0x490\n vsock_release+0x90/0x120\n __sock_release+0xa3/0x250\n sock_close+0x14/0x20\n __fput+0x35e/0xa90\n __x64_sys_close+0x78/0xd0\n do_syscall_64+0x93/0x1b0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e",
