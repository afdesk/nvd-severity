  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: mcast: extend RCU protection in igmp6_send()\n\nigmp6_send() can be called without RTNL or RCU being held.\n\nExtend RCU protection so that we can safely fetch the net pointer\nand avoid a potential UAF.\n\nNote that we no longer can use sock_alloc_send_skb() because\nipv6.igmp_sk uses GFP_KERNEL allocations which can sleep.\n\nInstead use alloc_skb() and charge the net->ipv6.igmp_sk\nsocket under RCU protection.",
