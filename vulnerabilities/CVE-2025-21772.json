  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npartitions: mac: fix handling of bogus partition table\n\nFix several issues in partition probing:\n\n - The bailout for a bad partoffset must use put_dev_sector(), since the\n   preceding read_part_sector() succeeded.\n - If the partition table claims a silly sector size like 0xfff bytes\n   (which results in partition table entries straddling sector boundaries),\n   bail out instead of accessing out-of-bounds memory.\n - We must not assume that the partition table contains proper NUL\n   termination - use strnlen() and strncmp() instead of strlen() and\n   strcmp().",
