  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: etas_es58x: fix potential NULL pointer dereference on udev->serial\n\nThe driver assumed that es58x_dev->udev->serial could never be NULL.\nWhile this is true on commercially available devices, an attacker\ncould spoof the device identity providing a NULL USB serial number.\nThat would trigger a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nAdd a check on es58x_dev->udev->serial before accessing it.",
