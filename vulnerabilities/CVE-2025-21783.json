  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: Fix crash on error in gpiochip_get_ngpios()\n\nThe gpiochip_get_ngpios() uses chip_*() macros to print messages.\nHowever these macros rely on gpiodev to be initialised and set,\nwhich is not the case when called via bgpio_init(). In such a case\nthe printing messages will crash on NULL pointer dereference.\nReplace chip_*() macros by the respective dev_*() ones to avoid\nsuch crash.",
