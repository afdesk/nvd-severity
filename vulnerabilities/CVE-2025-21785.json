  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: cacheinfo: Avoid out-of-bounds write to cacheinfo array\n\nThe loop that detects/populates cache information already has a bounds\ncheck on the array size but does not account for cache levels with\nseparate data/instructions cache. Fix this by incrementing the index\nfor any populated leaf (instead of any populated level).",
