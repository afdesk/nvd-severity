  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: sn-f-ospi: Fix division by zero\n\nWhen there is no dummy cycle in the spi-nor commands, both dummy bus cycle\nbytes and width are zero. Because of the cpu's warning when divided by\nzero, the warning should be avoided. Return just zero to avoid such\ncalculations.",
