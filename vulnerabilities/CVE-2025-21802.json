  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: fix oops when unload drivers paralleling\n\nWhen unload hclge driver, it tries to disable sriov first for each\nae_dev node from hnae3_ae_dev_list. If user unloads hns3 driver at\nthe time, because it removes all the ae_dev nodes, and it may cause\noops.\n\nBut we can't simply use hnae3_common_lock for this. Because in the\nprocess flow of pci_disable_sriov(), it will trigger the remove flow\nof VF, which will also take hnae3_common_lock.\n\nTo fixes it, introduce a new mutex to protect the unload process.",
