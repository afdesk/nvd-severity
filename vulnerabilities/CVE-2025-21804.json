  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: rcar-ep: Fix incorrect variable used when calling devm_request_mem_region()\n\nThe rcar_pcie_parse_outbound_ranges() uses the devm_request_mem_region()\nmacro to request a needed resource. A string variable that lives on the\nstack is then used to store a dynamically computed resource name, which\nis then passed on as one of the macro arguments. This can lead to\nundefined behavior.\n\nDepending on the current contents of the memory, the manifestations of\nerrors may vary. One possible output may be as follows:\n\n  $ cat /proc/iomem\n  30000000-37ffffff :\n  38000000-3fffffff :\n\nSometimes, garbage may appear after the colon.\n\nIn very rare cases, if no NULL-terminator is found in memory, the system\nmight crash because the string iterator will overrun which can lead to\naccess of unmapped memory above the stack.\n\nThus, fix this by replacing outbound_name with the name of the previously\nrequested resource. With the changes applied, the output will be as\nfollows:\n\n  $ cat /proc/iomem\n  30000000-37ffffff : memory2\n  38000000-3fffffff : memory3\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log]",
