  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nptp: Ensure info->enable callback is always set\n\nThe ioctl and sysfs handlers unconditionally call the ->enable callback.\nNot all drivers implement that callback, leading to NULL dereferences.\nExample of affected drivers: ptp_s390.c, ptp_vclock.c and ptp_mock.c.\n\nInstead use a dummy callback if no better was specified by the driver.",
