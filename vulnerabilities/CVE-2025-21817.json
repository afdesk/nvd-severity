  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: mark GFP_NOIO around sysfs ->store()\n\nsysfs ->store is called with queue freezed, meantime we have several\n->store() callbacks(update_nr_requests, wbt, scheduler) to allocate\nmemory with GFP_KERNEL which may run into direct reclaim code path,\nthen potential deadlock can be caused.\n\nFix the issue by marking NOIO around sysfs ->store()",
