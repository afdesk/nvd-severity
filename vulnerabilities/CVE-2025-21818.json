  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/xen: fix xen_hypercall_hvm() to not clobber %rbx\n\nxen_hypercall_hvm(), which is used when running as a Xen PVH guest at\nmost only once during early boot, is clobbering %rbx. Depending on\nwhether the caller relies on %rbx to be preserved across the call or\nnot, this clobbering might result in an early crash of the system.\n\nThis can be avoided by using an already saved register instead of %rbx.",
