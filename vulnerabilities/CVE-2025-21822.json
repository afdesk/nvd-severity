  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nptp: vmclock: Set driver data before its usage\n\nIf vmclock_ptp_register() fails during probing, vmclock_remove() is\ncalled to clean up the ptp clock and misc device.\nIt uses dev_get_drvdata() to access the vmclock state.\nHowever the driver data is not yet set at this point.\n\nAssign the driver data earlier.",
