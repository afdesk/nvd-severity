  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: reject mismatching sum of field_len with set key length\n\nThe field length description provides the length of each separated key\nfield in the concatenation, each field gets rounded up to 32-bits to\ncalculate the pipapo rule width from pipapo_init(). The set key length\nprovides the total size of the key aligned to 32-bits.\n\nRegister-based arithmetics still allows for combining mismatching set\nkey length and field length description, eg. set key length 10 and field\ndescription [ 5, 4 ] leading to pipapo width of 12.",
