  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: core: flush gadget workqueue after device removal\n\ndevice_del() can lead to new work being scheduled in gadget->work\nworkqueue. This is observed, for example, with the dwc3 driver with the\nfollowing call stack:\n  device_del()\n    gadget_unbind_driver()\n      usb_gadget_disconnect_locked()\n        dwc3_gadget_pullup()\n\t  dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()\n\t    usb_gadget_set_state()\n\t      schedule_work(&gadget->work)\n\nMove flush_work() after device_del() to ensure the workqueue is cleaned\nup.",
