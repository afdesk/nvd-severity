  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\namdkfd: properly free gang_ctx_bo when failed to init user queue\n\nThe destructor of a gtt bo is declared as\nvoid amdgpu_amdkfd_free_gtt_mem(struct amdgpu_device *adev, void **mem_obj);\nWhich takes void** as the second parameter.\n\nGCC allows passing void* to the function because void* can be implicitly\ncasted to any other types, so it can pass compiling.\n\nHowever, passing this void* parameter into the function's\nexecution process(which expects void** and dereferencing void**)\nwill result in errors.",
