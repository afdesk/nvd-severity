  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix softlockup in arena_map_free on 64k page kernel\n\nOn an aarch64 kernel with CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_64KB=y,\narena_htab tests cause a segmentation fault and soft lockup.\nThe same failure is not observed with 4k pages on aarch64.\n\nIt turns out arena_map_free() is calling\napply_to_existing_page_range() with the address returned by\nbpf_arena_get_kern_vm_start().  If this address is not page-aligned\nthe code ends up calling apply_to_pte_range() with that unaligned\naddress causing soft lockup.\n\nFix it by round up GUARD_SZ to PAGE_SIZE << 1 so that the\ndivision by 2 in bpf_arena_get_kern_vm_start() returns\na page-aligned value.",
