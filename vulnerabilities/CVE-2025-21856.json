  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/ism: add release function for struct device\n\nAccording to device_release() in /drivers/base/core.c,\na device without a release function is a broken device\nand must be fixed.\n\nThe current code directly frees the device after calling device_add()\nwithout waiting for other kernel parts to release their references.\nThus, a reference could still be held to a struct device,\ne.g., by sysfs, leading to potential use-after-free\nissues if a proper release function is not set.",
