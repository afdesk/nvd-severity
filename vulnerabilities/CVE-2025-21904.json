  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncaif_virtio: fix wrong pointer check in cfv_probe()\n\ndel_vqs() frees virtqueues, therefore cfv->vq_tx pointer should be checked\nfor NULL before calling it, not cfv->vdev. Also the current implementation\nis redundant because the pointer cfv->vdev is dereferenced before it is\nchecked for NULL.\n\nFix this by checking cfv->vq_tx for NULL instead of cfv->vdev before\ncalling del_vqs().",
