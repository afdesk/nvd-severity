  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mvm: clean up ROC on failure\n\nIf the firmware fails to start the session protection, then we\ndo call iwl_mvm_roc_finished() here, but that won't do anything\nat all because IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING was never set.\nSet IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING in the failure/stop path.\nIf it started successfully before, it's already set, so that\ndoesn't matter, and if it didn't start it needs to be set to\nclean up.\n\nNot doing so will lead to a WARN_ON() later on a fresh remain-\non-channel, since the link is already active when activated as\nit was never deactivated.",
