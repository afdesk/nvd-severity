  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/fair: Fix potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list\n\nchild_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a 'prev' pointer to a cfs_rq.\nThis 'prev' pointer can originate from struct rq's leaf_cfs_rq_list,\nmaking the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory\ncorruption. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and\nthe task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory\nfault or access garbage data.\n\nThe issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both\ncfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same\nleaf list. Also, rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.\n\nThis adds a check `if (prev == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main\nconditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of\noperation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.\n\nThis check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added\nto the list, so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list\nhead is enough.\n\nFixes a potential memory corruption issue that due to current struct\nlayout might not be manifesting as a crash but could lead to unpredictable\nbehavior when the layout changes.",
