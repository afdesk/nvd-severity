  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvlan: enforce underlying device type\n\nCurrently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.\n\nBesides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes a\nbug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.\n\nWhen creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)\nand MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.\n\nAs part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address of\neach applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.\n\n__dev_mc_add uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the new\nmulticast address.\n\nThis causes an out-of-bounds read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6,\nsince the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6\nbytes long.\n\nThis behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:\n\nip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo\nip l set up dev gretest\nip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100\n\nThen, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:\n\nip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21\n\nFix the bug by enforcing the type of the underlying device during VLAN\ndevice initialization.",
