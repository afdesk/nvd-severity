  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: make sure ptp clock is unregister and freed if hclge_ptp_get_cycle returns an error\n\nDuring the initialization of ptp, hclge_ptp_get_cycle might return an error\nand returned directly without unregister clock and free it. To avoid that,\ncall hclge_ptp_destroy_clock to unregist and free clock if\nhclge_ptp_get_cycle failed.",
