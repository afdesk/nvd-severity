  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-tcp: fix potential memory corruption in nvme_tcp_recv_pdu()\n\nnvme_tcp_recv_pdu() doesn't check the validity of the header length.\nWhen header digests are enabled, a target might send a packet with an\ninvalid header length (e.g. 255), causing nvme_tcp_verify_hdgst()\nto access memory outside the allocated area and cause memory corruptions\nby overwriting it with the calculated digest.\n\nFix this by rejecting packets with an unexpected header length.",
