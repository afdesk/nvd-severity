  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in resource_build_scaling_params\n\nNull pointer dereference issue could occur when pipe_ctx->plane_state\nis null. The fix adds a check to ensure 'pipe_ctx->plane_state' is not\nnull before accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference.\n\nFound by code review.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 63e6a77ccf239337baa9b1e7787cde9fa0462092)",
