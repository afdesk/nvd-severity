  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers: virt: acrn: hsm: Use kzalloc to avoid info leak in pmcmd_ioctl\n\nIn the \"pmcmd_ioctl\" function, three memory objects allocated by\nkmalloc are initialized by \"hcall_get_cpu_state\", which are then\ncopied to user space. The initializer is indeed implemented in\n\"acrn_hypercall2\" (arch/x86/include/asm/acrn.h). There is a risk of\ninformation leakage due to uninitialized bytes.",
