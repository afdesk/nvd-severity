  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Assign normalized_pix_clk when color depth = 14\n\n[WHY & HOW]\nA warning message \"WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 459 at ... /dc_resource.c:3397\ncalculate_phy_pix_clks+0xef/0x100 [amdgpu]\" occurs because the\ndisplay_color_depth == COLOR_DEPTH_141414 is not handled. This is\nobserved in Radeon RX 6600 XT.\n\nIt is fixed by assigning pix_clk * (14 * 3) / 24 - same as the rests.\n\nAlso fixes the indentation in get_norm_pix_clk.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 274a87eb389f58eddcbc5659ab0b180b37e92775)",
