  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: qla1280: Fix kernel oops when debug level > 2\n\nA null dereference or oops exception will eventually occur when qla1280.c\ndriver is compiled with DEBUG_QLA1280 enabled and ql_debug_level > 2.  I\nthink its clear from the code that the intention here is sg_dma_len(s) not\nlength of sg_next(s) when printing the debug info.",
