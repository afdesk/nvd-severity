  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses\n\n[WHAT & HOW]\nhpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4),\nbut location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to\ncheck location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.\n\nSimiliarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which\nshould be 0..5, so the ASSERT's conditions should be less without equal.",
