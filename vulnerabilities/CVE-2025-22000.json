  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/huge_memory: drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs\n\nWhen an after-split folio is large and needs to be dropped due to EOF,\nfolio_put_refs(folio, folio_nr_pages(folio)) should be used to drop all\npage cache refs.  Otherwise, the folio will not be freed, causing memory\nleak.\n\nThis leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a\ntruncate is performed, where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order\nones, causing truncated folios not being freed.",
