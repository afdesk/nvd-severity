  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hns: Fix soft lockup during bt pages loop\n\nDriver runs a for-loop when allocating bt pages and mapping them with\nbuffer pages. When a large buffer (e.g. MR over 100GB) is being allocated,\nit may require a considerable loop count. This will lead to soft lockup:\n\n        watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#27 stuck for 22s!\n        ...\n        Call trace:\n         hem_list_alloc_mid_bt+0x124/0x394 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_hem_list_request+0xf8/0x160 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_mtr_create+0x2e4/0x360 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         alloc_mr_pbl+0xd4/0x17c [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_reg_user_mr+0xf8/0x190 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         ib_uverbs_reg_mr+0x118/0x290\n\n        watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#35 stuck for 23s!\n        ...\n        Call trace:\n         hns_roce_hem_list_find_mtt+0x7c/0xb0 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         mtr_map_bufs+0xc4/0x204 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_mtr_create+0x31c/0x3c4 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         alloc_mr_pbl+0xb0/0x160 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         hns_roce_reg_user_mr+0x108/0x1c0 [hns_roce_hw_v2]\n         ib_uverbs_reg_mr+0x120/0x2bc\n\nAdd a cond_resched() to fix soft lockup during these loops. In order not\nto affect the allocation performance of normal-size buffer, set the loop\ncount of a 100GB MR as the threshold to call cond_resched().",
