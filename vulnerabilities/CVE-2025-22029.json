  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexec: fix the racy usage of fs_struct->in_exec\n\ncheck_unsafe_exec() sets fs->in_exec under cred_guard_mutex, then execve()\npaths clear fs->in_exec lockless. This is fine if exec succeeds, but if it\nfails we have the following race:\n\n\tT1 sets fs->in_exec = 1, fails, drops cred_guard_mutex\n\n\tT2 sets fs->in_exec = 1\n\n\tT1 clears fs->in_exec\n\n\tT2 continues with fs->in_exec == 0\n\nChange fs/exec.c to clear fs->in_exec with cred_guard_mutex held.",
