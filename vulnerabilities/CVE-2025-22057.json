  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: decrease cached dst counters in dst_release\n\nUpstream fix ac888d58869b (\"net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in\ndst_release()\") moved decrementing the dst count from dst_destroy to\ndst_release to avoid accessing already freed data in case of netns\ndismantle. However in case CONFIG_DST_CACHE is enabled and OvS+tunnels\nare used, this fix is incomplete as the same issue will be seen for\ncached dsts:\n\n  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff5aabf6b5c000\n  Call trace:\n   percpu_counter_add_batch+0x3c/0x160 (P)\n   dst_release+0xec/0x108\n   dst_cache_destroy+0x68/0xd8\n   dst_destroy+0x13c/0x168\n   dst_destroy_rcu+0x1c/0xb0\n   rcu_do_batch+0x18c/0x7d0\n   rcu_core+0x174/0x378\n   rcu_core_si+0x18/0x30\n\nFix this by invalidating the cache, and thus decrementing cached dst\ncounters, in dst_release too.",
