  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix array bounds error with may_goto\n\nmay_goto uses an additional 8 bytes on the stack, which causes the\ninterpreters[] array to go out of bounds when calculating index by\nstack_size.\n\n1. If a BPF program is rewritten, re-evaluate the stack size. For non-JIT\ncases, reject loading directly.\n\n2. For non-JIT cases, calculating interpreters[idx] may still cause\nout-of-bounds array access, and just warn about it.\n\n3. For jit_requested cases, the execution of bpf_func also needs to be\nwarned. So move the definition of function __bpf_prog_ret0_warn out of\nthe macro definition CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON.",
