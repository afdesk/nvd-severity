  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: brcmstb: Fix error path after a call to regulator_bulk_get()\n\nIf the regulator_bulk_get() returns an error and no regulators\nare created, we need to set their number to zero.\n\nIf we don't do this and the PCIe link up fails, a call to the\nregulator_bulk_free() will result in a kernel panic.\n\nWhile at it, print the error value, as we cannot return an error\nupwards as the kernel will WARN() on an error from add_bus().\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log, use comma in the message to match style with\nother similar messages]",
