  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/gem: Fix error code msm_parse_deps()\n\nThe SUBMIT_ERROR() macro turns the error code negative.  This extra '-'\noperation turns it back to positive EINVAL again.  The error code is\npassed to ERR_PTR() and since positive values are not an IS_ERR() it\neventually will lead to an oops.  Delete the '-'.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/637625/",
