  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Clear affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in error path\n\nIf a shared IRQ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the\nIRQ affinity hint is set right after the allocation of IRQ vectors in\nath12k_pci_msi_alloc(). This does no harm unless one of the functions\nrequesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.\n\nThis may end up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the\naffinity hint to be cleared before freeing the IRQ:\n\nkernel/irq/manage.c:\n\n\t/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */\n\tif (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc->affinity_hint))\n\t\tdesc->affinity_hint = NULL;\n\nSo to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling\nath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once\nagain further down the error path due to code organization, but that does\nno harm.",
