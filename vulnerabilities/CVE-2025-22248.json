  "Description": "The bitnami/pgpool\u00a0Docker image, and the bitnami/postgres-ha\u00a0k8s chart, under default configurations, comes with an 'repmgr' user that allows unauthenticated access to the database inside the cluster.\u00a0The PGPOOL_SR_CHECK_USER\u00a0is the user that Pgpool itself uses to perform streaming replication checks against nodes, and should not be at trust\u00a0level. This allows to log into a PostgreSQL database using the repgmr\u00a0user without authentication. If Pgpool is exposed externally, a potential attacker could use this user to get access to the service. This is also present within the bitnami/postgres-ha\u00a0Kubernetes Helm chart.",
