  "Description": "An attacker with access to the Administration panel, specifically the \"Role Management\"\ntab, can\ninject code by adding a new role in the \"name\" field. It should be noted, however, that the risk of exploiting vulnerability is reduced due to the\nrequired additional error that allows bypassing the Content-Security-Policy policy, which\nmitigates JS code execution while still allowing HTML injection.\n\n\nThis issue affects\u00a0CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager in SaaS version 24.7.1. The status of other versions is unknown.\u00a0After multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer.",
