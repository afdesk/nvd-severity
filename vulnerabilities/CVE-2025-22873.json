  "Description": "It was possible to improperly access the parent directory of an os.Root by opening a filename ending in \"../\". For example, Root.Open(\"../\") would open the parent directory of the Root. This escape only permits opening the parent directory itself, not ancestors of the parent or files contained within the parent.",
