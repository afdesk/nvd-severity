  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: pci_endpoint_test: Avoid issue of interrupts remaining after request_irq error\n\nAfter devm_request_irq() fails with error in pci_endpoint_test_request_irq(),\nthe pci_endpoint_test_free_irq_vectors() is called assuming that all IRQs\nhave been released.\n\nHowever, some requested IRQs remain unreleased, so there are still\n/proc/irq/* entries remaining, and this results in WARN() with the\nfollowing message:\n\n  remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/30', leaking at least 'pci-endpoint-test.0'\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 202 at fs/proc/generic.c:719 remove_proc_entry +0x190/0x19c\n\nTo solve this issue, set the number of remaining IRQs to test->num_irqs,\nand release IRQs in advance by calling pci_endpoint_test_release_irq().\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log]",
