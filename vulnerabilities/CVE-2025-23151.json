  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: host: Fix race between unprepare and queue_buf\n\nA client driver may use mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() to quiesce\nincoming data during the client driver's tear down. The client driver\nmight also be processing data at the same time, resulting in a call to\nmhi_queue_buf() which will invoke mhi_gen_tre(). If mhi_gen_tre() runs\nafter mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() has torn down the channel, a panic\nwill occur due to an invalid dereference leading to a page fault.\n\nThis occurs because mhi_gen_tre() does not verify the channel state\nafter locking it. Fix this by having mhi_gen_tre() confirm the channel\nstate is valid, or return error to avoid accessing deinitialized data.\n\n[mani: added stable tag]",
