  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: venus: hfi_parser: add check to avoid out of bound access\n\nThere is a possibility that init_codecs is invoked multiple times during\nmanipulated payload from video firmware. In such case, if codecs_count\ncan get incremented to value more than MAX_CODEC_NUM, there can be OOB\naccess. Reset the count so that it always starts from beginning.",
