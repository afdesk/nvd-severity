  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: venus: hfi: add check to handle incorrect queue size\n\nqsize represents size of shared queued between driver and video\nfirmware. Firmware can modify this value to an invalid large value. In\nsuch situation, empty_space will be bigger than the space actually\navailable. Since new_wr_idx is not checked, so the following code will\nresult in an OOB write.\n...\nqsize = qhdr->q_size\n\nif (wr_idx >= rd_idx)\n empty_space = qsize - (wr_idx - rd_idx)\n....\nif (new_wr_idx < qsize) {\n memcpy(wr_ptr, packet, dwords << 2) --> OOB write\n\nAdd check to ensure qsize is within the allocated size while\nreading and writing packets into the queue.",
