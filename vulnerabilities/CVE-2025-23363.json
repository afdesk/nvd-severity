  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Teamcenter V14.1 (All versions), Teamcenter V14.2 (All versions), Teamcenter V14.3 (All versions), Teamcenter V2312 (All versions), Teamcenter V2406 (All versions), Teamcenter V2412 (All versions). The SSO login service of affected applications accepts user-controlled input that could specify a link to an external site. This could allow an attacker to redirect the legitimate user to an attacker-chosen URL to steal valid session data. For a successful exploit, the legitimate user must actively click on an attacker-crafted link.",
