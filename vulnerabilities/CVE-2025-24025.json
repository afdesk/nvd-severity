  "Description": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.380, the tags page allows users to search for tags. If the search does not return any results, the query gets reflected on the error modal, which leads to cross-site scripting. Version 4.0.0-beta.380 fixes the issue.",
