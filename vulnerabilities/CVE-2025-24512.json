  "Description": "Improper input validation for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi Software for Windows before version 23.160 within Ring 2: Device Drivers may allow a denial of service. Authorized adversary with an authenticated user combined with a high complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are present with special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (low) impacts.",
