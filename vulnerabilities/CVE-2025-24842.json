  "Description": "Uncontrolled search path for the Intel(R) System Support Utility before version 4.1.0 within Ring 3: User Applications may allow an escalation of privilege. Unprivileged software adversary with a privileged user combined with a high complexity attack may enable local code execution. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are not present without special internal knowledge and requires passive user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (high) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.",
