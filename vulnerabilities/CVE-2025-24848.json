  "Description": "Protection mechanism failure for some Intel(R) CIP software before version WIN_DCA_2.4.0.11001 within Ring 3: User Applications may allow an escalation of privilege. Unprivileged software adversary with a privileged user combined with a high complexity attack may enable escalation of privilege. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge and requires passive user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (high) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.",
