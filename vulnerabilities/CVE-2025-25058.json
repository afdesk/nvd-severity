  "Description": "Improper initialization for some ESXi kernel mode driver for the Intel(R) Ethernet 800-Series before version 2.2.2.0 (esxi 8.0) &amp; 2.2.3.0 (esxi 9.0) within Ring 1: Device Drivers may allow an information disclosure. Unprivileged software adversary with an authenticated user combined with a low complexity attack may enable data exposure. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (low), integrity (none) and availability (none) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.",
