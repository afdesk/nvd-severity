  "Description": "The MouseTooltipTranslator Chrome extension allows mouseover translation of any language at once. The MouseTooltipTranslator browser extension is vulnerable to SSRF attacks. The pdf.mjs script uses the URL parameter from the current URL as the file to download and display to the extension user. Because pdf.mjs is imported in viewer.html and viewer.html is accessible to all URLs, an attacker can force the user\u2019s browser to make a request to any arbitrary URL. After discussion with maintainer, patching this issue would require disabling a major feature of the extension in exchange for a low severity vulnerability. Decision to not patch issue.",
