  "Description": "SoftEtherVPN 5.02.5187 is vulnerable to Use after Free in the Command.c file via the CheckNetworkAcceptThread function. NOTE: the Supplier disputes this because the use-after-free is not in the VPN software, but is instead in a separate tool that has no untrusted input and runs under the user's own privileges (it is a stress-testing tool for a networking stack).",
