  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in FS model S3150-8T2F switches running firmware s3150-8t2f-switch-fsos-220d_118101 and web firmware v2.2.2, which allows an authenticated web interface user to bypass input filtering on user names, and stores un-sanitized HTML and Javascript on the device. Pages which then present the user name without encoding special characters will then cause the injected code to be parsed by the browsers of other users accessing the web interface.",
