  "Description": "CloudClassroom-PHP-Project v1.0 is affected by an insecure credential transmission vulnerability. The application transmits passwords over unencrypted HTTP during the login process, exposing sensitive credentials to potential interception by network-based attackers. A remote attacker with access to the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi or compromised router) can capture login credentials via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) techniques. If the attacker subsequently uses the credentials to log in and exploit administrative functions (e.g., file upload), this may lead to remote code execution depending on the environment.",
