  "Description": "In onHandleForceStop of VoiceInteractionManagerService.java, there is a bug that could cause the system to incorrectly revert to the default assistant application when a user-selected assistant is forcibly stopped due to a logic error in the code. This could lead to local escalation of privilege where the default assistant app is  automatically granted ROLE_ASSISTANT with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
