  "Description": "The Data Services Management Console does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script. When a targeted victim, who is already logged in, clicks on the compromised link, the injected script gets executed within the scope of victim\ufffds browser. This potentially leads to an impact on confidentiality and integrity. Availability is not impacted.",
