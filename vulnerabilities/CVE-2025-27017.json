  "Description": "Apache NiFi 1.13.0 through 2.2.0 includes the username and password used to authenticate with MongoDB in the NiFi provenance events that MongoDB components generate during processing. An authorized user with read access to the provenance events of those processors may see the credentials information. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.3.0 is the recommended mitigation, which removes the credentials from provenance event records.",
