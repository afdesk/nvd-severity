  "Description": "axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. The issue occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios. Even if \u2060baseURL is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. This issue is fixed in 1.8.2.",
