  "Description": "Out-of-bounds write in the firmware for some Intel(R) Ethernet Controller E810 before version cvl fw 1.7.8.x within Ring 0: Bare Metal OS may allow a denial of service. System software adversary with a privileged user combined with a low complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are not present without special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.",
