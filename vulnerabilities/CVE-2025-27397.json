  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE LPE9403 (6GK5998-3GS00-2AC2) (All versions < V4.0). Affected devices do not properly limit user controlled paths to which logs are written and from where they are read.\r\nThis could allow an authenticated highly-privileged remote attacker to read and write arbitrary files in the filesystem, if and only if the malicious path ends with 'log' .",
