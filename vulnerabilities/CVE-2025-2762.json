  "Description": "CarlinKit CPC200-CCPA Missing Root of Trust Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of CarlinKit CPC200-CCPA devices. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the configuration of the application system-on-chip (SoC). The issue results from the lack of a properly configured hardware root of trust. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the boot process. Was ZDI-CAN-25948.",
