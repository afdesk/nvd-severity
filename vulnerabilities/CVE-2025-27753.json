The vulnerability is due to the use of unescaped user-supplied parameters in SQL queries within the dashboard component. This allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious SQL code through unsanitized input fields, which are used directly in SQL queries. Exploiting this flaw can lead to unauthorized database access, data leakage, or modification of records.",
