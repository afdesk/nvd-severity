  "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the Arctera InfoScale 7.0 through 8.0.2 where a .NET remoting endpoint can be exploited due to the insecure deserialization of potentially untrusted messages. The vulnerability is present in the Windows Plugin_Host service, which runs on all the servers where InfoScale is installed. The service is used only when applications are configured for Disaster Recovery (DR) using the DR wizard. Disabling the Plugin_Host service manually will eliminate the vulnerability.",
