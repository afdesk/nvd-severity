  "Description": "An insufficiently secured internal function allows session generation for arbitrary users. The decodeParam function checks the JWT but does not verify which signing algorithm was used. As a result, an attacker can use the \"ex:action\" parameter in the VerifyUserByThrustedService function to generate a session for any user.",
