  "Description": "In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited number of queries on a single, incoming TCP connection from a client, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a TCP exchange that triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.\n\nThe remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.\n\nA workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.\n\nWe would like to thank Renaud Allard for bringing this issue to our attention.",
