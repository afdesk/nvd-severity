  "Description": "A vulnerability in the ArxivReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, versions up to v0.12.22.post1, allows for MD5 hash collisions when generating filenames for downloaded papers. This can lead to data loss as papers with identical titles but different contents may overwrite each other, preventing some papers from being processed for AI model training. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.28.",
