  "Description": "A Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error vulnerability in the Layer 2 Control Protocol daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker sending a specifically malformed LLDP TLV to cause the l2cpd process to crash and restart, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).\u00a0 Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nWhen an LLDP telemetry subscription is active, receipt of a specifically malformed LLDP TLV causes the l2cpd process to crash and restart.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2;\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S10-EVO,\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S6-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S4-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R2-EVO.",
