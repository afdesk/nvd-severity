  "Description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the\u00a0syslog stream TCP transport\u00a0of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480 and MX960 devices with MX-SPC3 Security Services Card allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker, to send specific spoofed packets to cause a CPU Denial of Service (DoS) to the MX-SPC3 SPUs.\n\nContinued receipt and processing of these specific packets will sustain the DoS condition.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:  *  All versions before 22.2R3-S6,\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4,\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4,\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2\n\n\nAn indicator of compromise will indicate the SPC3 SPUs utilization has spiked.\n\n\nFor example:\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0user@device> show services service-sets summary\n                     Service sets                                                                               CPU\n  Interface          configured       Bytes used             Session bytes used        Policy bytes used        utilization\n  \"interface\"          1              \"bytes\" (percent%)     \"sessions\" (\"percent\"%)   \"bytes\" (\"percent\"%)     99.97 % OVLD  <<<<<< look for high CPU usage",
