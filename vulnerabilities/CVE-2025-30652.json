  "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged attacker executing a CLI command to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen\u00a0asregex-optimized is configured and a specific \"show route as-path\"\u00a0CLI command  is executed, the rpd crashes and restarts. Repeated execution of this command will cause a sustained DoS condition.\nThis issue affects Junos OS: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2.\n\n\n\nand Junos OS Evolved: \n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO, \n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R2-EVO.",
