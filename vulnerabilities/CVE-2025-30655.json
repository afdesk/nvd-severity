  "Description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a specific \"show bgp neighbor\" CLI command\u00a0is run, the rpd cpu utilization rises and eventually causes a crash and restart. Repeated use of this command will cause a sustained DoS condition.\u00a0\n\nThe device is only affected if BGP RIB sharding and update-threading is enabled.\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8,\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.\n\n\nand Junos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
