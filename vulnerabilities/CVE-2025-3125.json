  "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper input validation in the CarbonAppUploader admin service endpoint. An authenticated attacker with appropriate privileges can upload a malicious file to a user-controlled location on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nThis functionality is restricted by default to admin users; therefore, successful exploitation requires valid credentials with administrative permissions.",
