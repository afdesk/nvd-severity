  "Description": "Improper handling of values in the microcode flow for some Intel(R) Processor Family may allow an escalation of privilege. Startup code and smm adversary with a privileged user combined with a high complexity attack may enable escalation of privilege. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are present with special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (low), integrity (low) and availability (none) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (low), integrity (low) and availability (none) impacts.",
