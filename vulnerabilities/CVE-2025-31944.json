  "Description": "Race condition for some TDX Module before version tdx1.5 within Ring 0: Hypervisor may allow a denial of service. Authorized adversary with a privileged user combined with a high complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (low) impacts.",
