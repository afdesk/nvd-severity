  "Description": "Out-of-bounds read in the firmware for some 100GbE Intel(R) Ethernet Network Adapter E810 before version cvl fw 1.7.6, cpk 1.3.7 within Ring 0: Bare Metal OS may allow a denial of service. Network adversary with an authenticated user combined with a low complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially occur via network access when attack requirements are present with special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.",
