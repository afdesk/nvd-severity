  "Description": "bep/imagemeta is a Go library for reading EXIF, IPTC and XMP image meta data from JPEG, TIFF, PNG, and WebP files. The EXIF data format allows for defining excessively large data structures in relatively small payloads. Before v0.10.0, If you didn't trust the input images, this could be abused to construct denial-of-service attacks. v0.10.0 added LimitNumTags (default 5000) and LimitTagSize (default 10000) options.",
