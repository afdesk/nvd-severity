  "Description": "HAX CMS PHP allows you to manage your microsite universe with PHP backend. Multiple file upload functions within the HAX CMS PHP application call a \u2019save\u2019 function in \u2019HAXCMSFile.php\u2019. This save function uses a denylist to block specific file types from being uploaded to the server. This list is non-exhaustive and only blocks \u2019.php\u2019, \u2019.sh\u2019, \u2019.js\u2019, and \u2019.css\u2019 files. The existing logic causes the system to \"fail open\" rather than \"fail closed.\" This vulnerability is fixed in 10.0.3.",
