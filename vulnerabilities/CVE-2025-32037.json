  "Description": "Improper access control for some Intel(R) PresentMon before version 2.3.1 within Ring 3: User Applications may allow a denial of service. Network adversary with a privileged user combined with a high complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially occur via adjacent access when attack requirements are not present without special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (low) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.",
