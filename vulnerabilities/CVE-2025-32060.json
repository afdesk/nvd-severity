  "Description": "The system suffers from the absence of a kernel module signature verification. If an attacker can execute commands on behalf of root user (due to additional vulnerabilities), then he/she is also able to load custom kernel modules to the kernel space and execute code in the kernel context. Such a flaw can lead to taking control over the entire system.\n\n\n\nFirst identified on Nissan Leaf ZE1 manufactured in 2020.",
