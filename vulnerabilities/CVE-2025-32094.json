  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Akamai Ghost, as used for the Akamai CDN platform before 2025-03-26. Under certain circumstances, a client making an HTTP/1.x OPTIONS request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header, and using obsolete line folding, can lead to a discrepancy in how two in-path Akamai servers interpret the request, allowing an attacker to smuggle a second request in the original request body.",
