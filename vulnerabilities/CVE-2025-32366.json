  "Description": "In ConnMan through 1.44, parse_rr in dnsproxy.c has a memcpy length that depends on an RR RDLENGTH value, i.e., *rdlen=ntohs(rr->rdlen) and memcpy(response+offset,*end,*rdlen) without a check for whether the sum of *end and *rdlen exceeds max. Consequently, *rdlen may be larger than the amount of remaining packet data in the current state of parsing. Values of stack memory locations may be sent over the network in a response.",
