  "Description": "An issue was discovered on goTenna v1 devices with app 5.5.3 and firmware 0.25.5. By default, the GID is the user's phone number unless they specifically opt out. A phone number is very sensitive information because it can be tied back to individuals. The app does not encrypt the GID in messages.",
