  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in multiple models of Selea Targa IP OCR-ANPR cameras, including iZero, Targa 512, Targa 504, Targa Semplice, Targa 704 TKM, Targa 805, Targa 710 INOX, Targa 750, and Targa 704 ILB. The /common/get_file.php script in the \u201cDownload Archive in Storage\u201d page fails to properly validate user-supplied input to the file parameter. Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the device, including sensitive system files containing cleartext credentials, potentially leading to authentication bypass and exposure of system information.",
