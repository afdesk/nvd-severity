  "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Moodle LMS Jmol plugin version 6.1 and prior via the query parameter in jsmol.php. The script directly passes user input to the file_get_contents() function without proper validation, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by crafting a malicious query value. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication and may expose sensitive configuration data, including database credentials.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-02 UTC.",
