  "Description": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists in Fanwei e-cology 8.0 via the getdata.jsp endpoint. The application directly passes unsanitized user input from the sql parameter into a database query within the getSelectAllIds(sql, type) method, reachable through the cmd=getSelectAllId workflow in the AjaxManager. This allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially exposing sensitive data such as administrator password hashes.",
