  "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in the Zhiyuan OA platform via the wpsAssistServlet interface. The realFileType and fileId parameters are improperly validated during multipart file uploads, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload crafted JSP files outside of intended directories using path traversal. Successful exploitation enables remote code execution as the uploaded file can be accessed and executed through the web server.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-01 UTC.",
