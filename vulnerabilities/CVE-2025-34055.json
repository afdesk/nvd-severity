  "Description": "An OS command injection vulnerability exists in AVTECH DVR, NVR, and IP camera devices within the adcommand.cgi endpoint, which interfaces with the ActionD daemon. Authenticated users can invoke the DoShellCmd operation, passing arbitrary input via the strCmd parameter. This input is executed directly by the system shell without sanitation allowing attackers to execute commands as the root user.",
