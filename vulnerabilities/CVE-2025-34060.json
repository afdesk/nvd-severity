  "Description": "A PHP objection injection vulnerability exists in the Monero Project\u2019s Laravel-based forum software due to unsafe handling of untrusted input in the /get/image/ endpoint. The application passes a user-supplied link parameter directly to file_get_contents() without validation. MIME type checks using PHP\u2019s finfo can be bypassed via crafted stream filter chains that prepend spoofed headers, allowing access to internal Laravel configuration files. An attacker can extract the APP_KEY from config/app.php, forge encrypted cookies, and trigger unsafe unserialize() calls, leading to reliable remote code execution.",
