  "Description": "An unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the WordPress Simple File List plugin prior to version 4.2.3 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve remote code execution. The plugin's upload endpoint (ee-upload-engine.php) restricts file uploads based on extension, but lacks proper validation after file renaming. An attacker can first upload a PHP payload disguised as a .png file, then use the plugin\u2019s ee-file-engine.php rename functionality to change the extension to .php. This bypasses upload restrictions and results in the uploaded payload being executable on the server.",
