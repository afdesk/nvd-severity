  "Description": "A directory traversal vulnerability exists in ColoradoFTP Server \u2264 1.3 Build 8 for Windows, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read or write arbitrary files outside the configured FTP root directory. The flaw is due to insufficient sanitation of user-supplied file paths in the FTP GET and PUT command handlers. Exploitation is possible by submitting traversal sequences during FTP operations, enabling access to system-sensitive files. This issue affects only the Windows version of ColoradoFTP.",
