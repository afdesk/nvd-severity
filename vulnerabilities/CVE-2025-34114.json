  "Description": "A client-side security misconfiguration vulnerability exists in OpenBlow whistleblowing platform across multiple versions and default deployments, due to the absence of critical HTTP response headers including Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy, and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy. This omission weakens browser-level defenses and exposes users to cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and referer leakage. Although some instances attempt to enforce CSP via HTML <meta> tags, this method is ineffective, as modern browsers rely on header-based enforcement to reliably block inline scripts and untrusted resources.",
