  "Description": "Wimi Teamwork versions prior to 7.38.17 contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in its API. The API accepts any authenticated request that contains a JSON field named 'csrf_token' without validating the field\u2019s value; only the presence of the field is checked. An attacker can craft a cross-site request that causes a logged-in victim\u2019s browser to submit a JSON POST containing an arbitrary or empty 'csrf_token', and the API will execute the request with the victim\u2019s privileges. Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to perform privileged actions as the victim potentially resulting in account takeover, privilege escalation, or service disruption.",
