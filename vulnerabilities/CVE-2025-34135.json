  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to\u00a02024R1.4.2\u00a0configure some systemd unit files with permission sets that were too permissive. In particular, the nagios.service unit had executable permissions that were not required. Overly permissive permissions on service unit files can broaden local attack surface by enabling unintended execution behaviors or facilitating abuse of service operations when combined with other weaknesses.",
