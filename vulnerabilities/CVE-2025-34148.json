  "Description": "An unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Shenzhen Aitemi M300 Wi-Fi Repeater (hardware model MT02). When configuring the device in WISP mode, the 'ssid' parameter is passed unsanitized to system-level scripts. This allows remote attackers within Wi-Fi range to inject arbitrary shell commands that execute as root, resulting in full device compromise.",
