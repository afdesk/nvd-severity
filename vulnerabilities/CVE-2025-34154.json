  "Description": "UnForm Server Manager versions prior to 10.1.12 expose an unauthenticated file read vulnerability via its log file analysis interface. The flaw resides in the arc endpoint, which accepts a fl parameter to specify the log file to be opened. Due to insufficient input validation and lack of path sanitization, attackers can supply relative paths to access arbitrary files on the host system \u2014 including sensitive OS-level files \u2014 without authentication.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN",
