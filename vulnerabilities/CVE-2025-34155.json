  "Description": "Tibbo AggreGate Network Manager < 6.40.05 contains an observable response discrepancy in its login functionality. Authentication failure messages differ based on whether a supplied username exists or not, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to infer valid account identifiers. This can facilitate user enumeration and increase the likelihood of targeted brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.",
