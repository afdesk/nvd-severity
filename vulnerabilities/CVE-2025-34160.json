  "Description": "AnyShare contains a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the ServiceAgent API exposed on port 10250. The endpoint /api/ServiceAgent/start_service accepts user-supplied input via POST and fails to sanitize command-like payloads. An attacker can inject shell syntax that is interpreted by the backend, enabling arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to August 2025 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range remains undefined.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-11 UTC.",
