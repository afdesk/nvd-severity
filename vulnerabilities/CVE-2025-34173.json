  "Description": "In pfSense CE\u00a0/usr/local/www/snort/snort_ip_reputation.php, the value of the iplist parameter is not sanitized of directory traversal-related characters/strings before being used to check if a file exists. While the contents of the file cannot be read, the server reveals whether a file exists, which allows an attacker to enumerate files on the target. The attacker must be authenticated with at least \"WebCfg - Services: Snort package\" permissions.",
