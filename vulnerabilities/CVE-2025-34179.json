The server evaluates request URIs using an unsanitized SQLite query against the FileLinks table in gateway.db. By injecting SQL through the LinkName/URI value, a remote attacker can control the FileName field used by the server to read and return files from disk, resulting in arbitrary local file disclosure.",
