  "Description": "Ilevia EVE X1/X5 Server version \u2264 4.7.18.0.eden contains a vulnerability in its authentication mechanism. Unsanitized input is passed to a system() call for authentication, allowing attackers to inject special characters and manipulate command parsing. Due to the binary's interpretation of non-zero exit codes as successful authentication, remote attackers can bypass authentication and gain full access to the system.",
