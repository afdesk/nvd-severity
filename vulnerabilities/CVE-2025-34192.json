  "Description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.893 and Application versions prior to 20.0.2140 (macOS/Linux client deployments) are built against OpenSSL 1.0.2h-fips (released May 2016), which has been end-of-life since 2019 and is no longer supported by the OpenSSL project. Continued use of this outdated cryptographic library exposes deployments to known vulnerabilities that are no longer patched, weakening the overall security posture. Affected daemons may emit deprecation warnings and rely on cryptographic components with unresolved security flaws, potentially enabling attackers to exploit weaknesses in TLS/SSL processing or cryptographic operations.",
