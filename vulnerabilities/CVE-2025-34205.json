  "Description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.843 and\u00a0Application prior to 20.0.1923 (VA and SaaS deployments) contains dangerous PHP dead code present in multiple Docker-hosted PHP instances. A script named /var/www/app/resetroot.php (found in several containers) lacks authentication checks and, when executed, performs a SQL update that sets the database administrator username to 'root' and its password hash to the SHA-512 hash of the string 'password'. Separately, commented-out code in /var/www/app/lib/common/oses.php would unserialize session data (unserialize($_SESSION['osdata']))\u2014a pattern that can enable remote code execution if re-enabled or reached with attacker-controlled serialized data. An attacker able to reach the resetroot.php endpoint can trivially reset the MySQL root password and obtain full database control; combined with deserialization issues this can lead to full remote code execution and system compromise.",
