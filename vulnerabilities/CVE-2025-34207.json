  "Description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to 22.0.1049 and Application prior to 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments)\u00a0configure the SSH client within Docker instances with the following options: `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, and `ForwardAgent yes`.  These settings disable verification of the remote host\u2019s SSH key and automatically forward the developer\u2019s SSH\u2011agent to any host that matches the configured wildcard patterns.  As a result, an attacker who can reach a single compromised container can cause the container to connect to a malicious SSH server, capture the forwarded private keys, and use those keys for unrestricted lateral movement across the environment.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-027 \u2014 Insecure Secure Shell (SSH) Configuration.",
