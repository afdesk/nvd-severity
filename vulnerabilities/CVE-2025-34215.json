  "Description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1026 and Application prior to version 20.0.2702 (only VA deployments) expose an unauthenticated firmware-upload flow: a public page returns a signed token usable at va-api/v1/update, and every Docker image contains the appliance\u2019s private GPG key and hard-coded passphrase. An attacker who extracts the key and obtains a token can decrypt, modify, re-sign, upload, and trigger malicious firmware, gaining remote code execution.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-020 \u2014 Remote Code Execution.",
