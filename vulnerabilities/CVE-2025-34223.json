  "Description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049\u00a0and Application prior to version 20.0.2786\u00a0(VA/SaaS deployments) contain\u00a0a default admin account\u00a0and an installation\u2011time endpoint at `/admin/query/update_database.php` that can be accessed without authentication. An attacker who can reach the installation web interface can POST arbitrary `root_user` and `root_password` values, causing the script to replace the default admin credentials with attacker\u2011controlled ones. The script also contains hard\u2011coded SHA\u2011512 and SHA\u20111 hashes of the default password, allowing the attacker to bypass password\u2011policy validation. As a result, an unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain full administrative control of the system during the initial setup.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-022 \u2014 Insecure Installation Credentials.",
