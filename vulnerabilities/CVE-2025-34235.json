  "Description": "Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102 and Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (Windows client deployments) contain a registry key that can be enabled by administrators, causing the client to skip SSL/TLS certificate validation. An attacker who can intercept HTTPS traffic can then inject malicious driver DLLs, resulting in remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges; a local attacker can achieve local privilege escalation via a junction\u2011point DLL injection.\u00a0This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.",
