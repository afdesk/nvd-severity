  "Description": "Tesla Telematics Control Unit (TCU) firmware prior to v2025.14 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. The TCU runs the Android Debug Bridge (adbd) as root and, despite a \u201clockdown\u201d check that disables adb shell, still permits adb push/pull and adb forward. Because adbd is privileged and the device\u2019s USB port is exposed externally, an attacker with physical access can write an arbitrary file to a writable location and then overwrite the kernel\u2019s uevent_helper or /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug entries via ADB, causing the script to be executed with root privileges.",
