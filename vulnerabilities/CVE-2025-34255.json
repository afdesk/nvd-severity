  "Description": "D-Link Nuclias Connect firmware versions <= 1.3.1.4 contain an observable response discrepancy vulnerability.\u00a0The application's 'Forgot Password' endpoint returns distinct JSON responses depending on whether the supplied email address is associated with an existing account. Because the responses differ in the `data.exist` boolean value, an unauthenticated remote attacker can enumerate valid email addresses/accounts on the server.\u00a0NOTE: D-Link states that a fix is under development.",
