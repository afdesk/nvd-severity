  "Description": "Nagios Fusion versions prior to R2.1 contain a vulnerability due to the application not requiring re-authentication or session rotation when a user has enabled two-factor authentication (2FA). As a result, an adversary who has obtained a valid session could continue using the active session after the target user enabled 2FA, potentially preventing the legitimate user from locking the attacker out and enabling persistent account takeover.",
