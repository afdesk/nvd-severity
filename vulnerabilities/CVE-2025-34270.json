  "Description": "Nagios Log Server versions prior to 2024R2.0.2 contain a vulnerability in the AD/LDAP user import functionality as it fails to obfuscate the password field during import. As a result, the plaintext password supplied for imported accounts may be exposed in the user interface, logs, or other diagnostic output. This can leak sensitive credentials to administrators or anyone with access to import results.",
