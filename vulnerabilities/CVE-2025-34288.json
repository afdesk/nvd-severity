  "Description": "Nagios XI versions prior to 2026R1.1 are\u00a0vulnerable to local privilege escalation due to an unsafe interaction between sudo permissions and application file permissions. A user\u2011accessible maintenance script may be executed as root via sudo and includes an application file that is writable by a lower\u2011privileged user. A local attacker with access to the application account can modify this file to introduce malicious code, which is then executed with elevated privileges when the script is run. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution as the root user.",
