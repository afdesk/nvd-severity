  "Description": "IPFire versions prior to 2.29 (Core Update 198) contain a SQL injection vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker to manipulate the SQL query used when viewing OpenVPN connection logs via the CONNECTION_NAME parameter. When viewing a range of OpenVPN connection logs, the application issues an HTTP POST request to the Request-URI /cgi-bin/logs.cgi/ovpnclients.dat and inserts the value of the CONNECTION_NAME parameter directly into the WHERE clause\u00a0without proper sanitization or parameterization. The unsanitized value can alter the executed query and be used to disclose sensitive information from the database.",
