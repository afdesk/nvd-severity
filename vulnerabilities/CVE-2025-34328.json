  "Description": "AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23 include a web administration component (F2MAdmin) that exposes an unauthenticated script-management endpoint at AudioCodes_files/utils/IVR/diagram/ajaxScript.php. The saveScript action writes attacker-supplied data directly to a server-side file path under the privileges of the web service account, which runs as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM on Windows deployments. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can write arbitrary files into the product\u2019s web-accessible directory structure and subsequently execute them.",
