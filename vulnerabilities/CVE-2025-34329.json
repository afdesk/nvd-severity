  "Description": "AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23 expose an unauthenticated backup upload endpoint at AudioCodes_files/ajaxBackupUploadFile.php in the F2MAdmin web interface. The script derives a backup folder path from application configuration, creates the directory if it does not exist, and then moves an uploaded file to that location using the attacker-controlled filename, without any authentication, authorization, or file-type validation. On default Windows deployments where the backup directory resolves to the system drive, a remote attacker can upload web server or interpreter configuration files that cause a log file or other server-controlled resource to be treated as executable code. This allows subsequent HTTP requests to trigger arbitrary command execution under the web server account, which runs as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM.",
