  "Description": "AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23\u00a0include a web administration component (F2MAdmin) that exposes an unauthenticated prompt upload endpoint at AudioCodes_files/utils/IVR/diagram/ajaxPromptUploadFile.php. The script accepts an uploaded file and writes it into the C:\\\\F2MAdmin\\\\tmp directory using a filename derived from application constants, without any authentication, authorization, or file-type validation. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can upload or overwrite prompt- or music-on-hold\u2013related files in this directory, potentially leading to tampering with IVR audio content or preparing files for use in further attacks.",
