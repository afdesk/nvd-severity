  "Description": "MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain\u00a0a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the AddressesCc parameter of /Mondo/lang/sys/Forms/AddressBook.aspx. The AddressesCc value is not properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected within a <script> block in the JavaScript variable var sAddrCc. By supplying a crafted payload that terminates the existing LoadCurAddresses() function, inserts attacker-controlled script, and comments out remaining code, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim\u2019s browser when the victim attempts to send an email. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to malicious sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies, inject arbitrary HTML or CSS, and perform actions as the authenticated user.",
