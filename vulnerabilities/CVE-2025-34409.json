  "Description": "MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain\u00a0a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Failed parameter of /Mondo/lang/sys/Forms/MAI/AddRecipientsResult.aspx. The Failed value is not properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected in the response, allowing an attacker to break out of existing markup and inject arbitrary script. A remote attacker can supply a crafted payload that closes an existing HTML list element, inserts attacker-controlled JavaScript, and comments out remaining code, leading to script execution in a victim\u2019s browser when the victim visits a malicious link. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to malicious sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies, inject arbitrary HTML or CSS, and perform actions as the authenticated user.",
