  "Description": "The Convercent Whistleblowing Platform operated by EQS Group exposes an unauthenticated API endpoint at /GetLegalEntity that returns internal customer legal-entity names based on a supplied searchText fragment. A remote unauthenticated attacker can query the endpoint using common legal-suffix terms to enumerate Convercent tenants, identifying organizations using the platform. This disclosure can facilitate targeted phishing, extortion, or other attacks against whistleblowing programs and reveals sensitive business relationships and compliance infrastructure.",
