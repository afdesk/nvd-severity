  "Description": "The Convercent Whistleblowing Platform operated by EQS Group contains a protection mechanism failure in its browser and session handling. By default, affected deployments omit HTTP security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy, and implement incomplete clickjacking protections. The application also issues session cookies with insecure or inconsistent attributes by default, including duplicate ASP.NET_SessionId values, an affinity cookie missing the Secure attribute, and mixed or absent SameSite settings. These deficiencies weaken browser-side isolation and session integrity, increasing exposure to client-side attacks, session fixation, and cross-site session leakage.",
