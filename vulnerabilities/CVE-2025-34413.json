  "Description": "Legality WHISTLEBLOWING by DigitalPA contains a protection mechanism failure in which critical HTTP security headers are not emitted by default. Affected deployments omit Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (with CSP delivered via HTML meta elements being inadequate). The absence of these headers weakens browser-side defenses and increases exposure to client-side attacks such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking, referer leakage, and cross-origin data disclosure.",
