  "Description": "MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain an unsafe DLL loading vulnerability that can lead to local arbitrary code execution. The MailEnable administrative executable attempts to load MEAISM.DLL from its installation directory without sufficient integrity validation or a secure search order. A local attacker with write access to that directory can plant a malicious MEAISM.DLL, which is then loaded when the executable starts, resulting in execution of attacker-controlled code with the privileges of the process.",
