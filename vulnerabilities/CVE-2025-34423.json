  "Description": "MailEnable versions prior to 10.54 contain an unsafe DLL loading vulnerability that can lead to local arbitrary code execution. The MailEnable administrative executable attempts to load MEAIAU.DLL from its installation directory without sufficient integrity validation or a secure search order. A local attacker with write access to that directory can plant a malicious MEAIAU.DLL, which is then loaded on execution, resulting in attacker-controlled code running with the privileges of the process.",
