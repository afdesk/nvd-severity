  "Description": "1Panel versions 1.10.33 through 2.0.15 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the panel name management functionality. The affected endpoint does not implement CSRF defenses such as anti-CSRF tokens or Origin/Referer validation. An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that submits a panel-name change request; if a victim visits the page while authenticated, the browser includes valid session cookies and the request succeeds. This allows a remote attacker to change the victim\u2019s panel name to an arbitrary value without consent.",
