{
  "Description": "wb2osz/direwolf (Dire Wolf) versions up to and including 1.8, prior to commit 3658a87, contain a reachable assertion vulnerability in the APRS MIC-E decoder function aprs_mic_e() located in src/decode_aprs.c. When processing a specially crafted AX.25 frame containing a MIC-E message with an empty or truncated comment field, the application triggers an unhandled assertion checking for a non-empty comment. This assertion failure causes immediate process termination, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by sending malformed APRS traffic.",
