  "Description": "Multiple robotic products by Unitree sharing a common firmware, including the Go2, G1, H1, and B2 devices, contain a command injection vulnerability. By setting a malicious string when configuring the on-board WiFi via a BLE module of an affected robot, then triggering a restart of the WiFi service, an attacker can ultimately trigger commands to be run as root via the wpa_supplicant_restart.sh shell script.\u00a0All Unitree models use firmware derived from the same codebase (MIT Cheetah), and the two major forks are the G1 (humanoid) and Go2 (quadruped) branches.",
