  "Description": "It technically possible for a user to upload a file to a conversation despite the file upload functionality being disabled.\n\nThe file upload functionality can be enabled or disabled for specific use cases through configuration. In case the functionality is disabled for at least one use case, the system nevertheless allows files to be uploaded through direct API requests. During the upload file, interception and allowed file type rules are still applied correctly.\n\nIf file sharing is generally enabled, this issue is not of concern.",
