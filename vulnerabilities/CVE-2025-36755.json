  "Description": "The CleverDisplay BlueOne hardware player is designed with its USB interfaces physically enclosed and inaccessible under normal operating conditions. Researchers demonstrated that, after cicumventing the device\u2019s protective enclosure, it was possible to connect a USB keyboard and press ESC during boot to access the BIOS setup interface. BIOS settings could be viewed but not modified. This behavior slightly increases the attack surface by exposing internal system information (CWE-1244) once the enclosure is removed, but does not allow integrity or availability compromise under standard or tested configurations.",
