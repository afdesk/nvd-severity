  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer deference in mtk_iommu_device_group\n\nCurrently, mtk_iommu calls during probe iommu_device_register before\nthe hw_list from driver data is initialized. Since iommu probing issue\nfix, it leads to NULL pointer dereference in mtk_iommu_device_group when\nhw_list is accessed with list_first_entry (not null safe).\n\nSo, change the call order to ensure iommu_device_register is called\nafter the driver data are initialized.",
