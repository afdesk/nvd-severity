  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: tls: explicitly disallow disconnect\n\nsyzbot discovered that it can disconnect a TLS socket and then\nrun into all sort of unexpected corner cases. I have a vague\nrecollection of Eric pointing this out to us a long time ago.\nSupporting disconnect is really hard, for one thing if offload\nis enabled we'd need to wait for all packets to be _acked_.\nDisconnect is not commonly used, disallow it.\n\nThe immediate problem syzbot run into is the warning in the strp,\nbut that's just the easiest bug to trigger:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5834 at net/tls/tls_strp.c:486 tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486\n  RIP: 0010:tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   tls_rx_rec_wait+0x280/0xa60 net/tls/tls_sw.c:1363\n   tls_sw_recvmsg+0x85c/0x1c30 net/tls/tls_sw.c:2043\n   inet6_recvmsg+0x2c9/0x730 net/ipv6/af_inet6.c:678\n   sock_recvmsg_nosec net/socket.c:1023 [inline]\n   sock_recvmsg+0x109/0x280 net/socket.c:1045\n   __sys_recvfrom+0x202/0x380 net/socket.c:2237",
