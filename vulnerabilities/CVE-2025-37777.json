  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix use-after-free in __smb2_lease_break_noti()\n\nMove tcp_transport free to ksmbd_conn_free. If ksmbd connection is\nreferenced when ksmbd server thread terminates, It will not be freed,\nbut conn->tcp_transport is freed. __smb2_lease_break_noti can be performed\nasynchronously when the connection is disconnected. __smb2_lease_break_noti\ncalls ksmbd_conn_write, which can cause use-after-free\nwhen conn->ksmbd_transport is already freed.",
