  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: Fix dangling pointer in krb_authenticate\n\nkrb_authenticate frees sess->user and does not set the pointer\nto NULL. It calls ksmbd_krb5_authenticate to reinitialise\nsess->user but that function may return without doing so. If\nthat happens then smb2_sess_setup, which calls krb_authenticate,\nwill be accessing free'd memory when it later uses sess->user.",
