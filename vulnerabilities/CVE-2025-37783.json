  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dpu: Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check\n\nThe function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check was dereferencing pointers\nreturned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors. This\ncould lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer.\n\nThis commit adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is\nvalid before dereferencing them.\n\nSimilar to commit da29abe71e16\n(\"drm/amd/display: Fix error pointers in amdgpu_dm_crtc_mem_type_changed\").\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/643132/",
