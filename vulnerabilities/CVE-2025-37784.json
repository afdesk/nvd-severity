  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ti: icss-iep: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference for perout request\n\nThe ICSS IEP driver tracks perout and pps enable state with flags.\nCurrently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit(),\nresults in NULL pointer dereference for perout.\n\nTo fix the null pointer dereference issue, the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw\nfunction can be modified to directly clear the IEP CMP registers when\ndisabling PPS or PEROUT, without referencing the ptp_perout_request\nstructure, as its contents are irrelevant in this case.",
