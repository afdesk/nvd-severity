  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path\n\nIn the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port, a\nmemory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds,\nbut the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow\ngoes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from\n(i-1)th iteration are freed.\n\nFix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.",
