  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndriver core: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dev_uevent()\n\nIf userspace reads \"uevent\" device attribute at the same time as another\nthreads unbinds the device from its driver, change to dev->driver from a\nvalid pointer to NULL may result in crash. Fix this by using READ_ONCE()\nwhen fetching the pointer, and take bus' drivers klist lock to make sure\ndriver instance will not disappear while we access it.\n\nUse WRITE_ONCE() when setting the driver pointer to ensure there is no\ntearing.",
