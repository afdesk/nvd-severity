  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nLoongArch: Return NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMD\n\nLoongArch's huge_pte_offset() currently returns a pointer to a PMD slot\neven if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating no\nmapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entry\nvalue (the address of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.\n\nThe generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly identifies this address\nas a swap entry on LoongArch, because it satisfies the \"!pte_present()\n&& !pte_none()\" conditions. This misinterpretation, combined with a\ncoincidental match by is_migration_entry() on the address bits, leads to\nkernel crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().\n\nFix this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() to\ncheck the PMD entry's content using pmd_none() before returning. If the\nentry is invalid (i.e., it points to invalid_pte_table), return NULL\ninstead of the pointer to the slot.",
