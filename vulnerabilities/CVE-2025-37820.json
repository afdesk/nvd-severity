  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen-netfront: handle NULL returned by xdp_convert_buff_to_frame()\n\nThe function xdp_convert_buff_to_frame() may return NULL if it fails\nto correctly convert the XDP buffer into an XDP frame due to memory\nconstraints, internal errors, or invalid data. Failing to check for NULL\nmay lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the result is used later in\nprocessing, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or undefined\nbehavior.\n\nOn XDP redirect failure, the associated page must be released explicitly\nif it was previously retained via get_page(). Failing to do so may result\nin a memory leak, as the pages reference count is not decremented.",
