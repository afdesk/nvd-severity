  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()\n\nA race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler:\nonce a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq->mq_hctx to\nNULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in\nufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is\ndereferenced, the kernel will crash.\n\nAdd a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an\nerror and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer\ndereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is\nremoved.\n\nThis is similar to the fix in commit 74736103fb41 (\"scsi: ufs: core: Fix\nufshcd_abort_one racing issue\").\n\nThis is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.",
