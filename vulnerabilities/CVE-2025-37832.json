  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncpufreq: sun50i: prevent out-of-bounds access\n\nA KASAN enabled kernel reports an out-of-bounds access when handling the\nnvmem cell in the sun50i cpufreq driver:\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sun50i_cpufreq_nvmem_probe+0x180/0x3d4\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff000006bf31e0 by task kworker/u16:1/38\n\nThis is because the DT specifies the nvmem cell as covering only two\nbytes, but we use a u32 pointer to read the value. DTs for other SoCs\nindeed specify 4 bytes, so we cannot just shorten the variable to a u16.\n\nFortunately nvmem_cell_read() allows to return the length of the nvmem\ncell, in bytes, so we can use that information to only access the valid\nportion of the data.\nTo cover multiple cell sizes, use memcpy() to copy the information into a\nzeroed u32 buffer, then also make sure we always read the data in little\nendian fashion, as this is how the data is stored in the SID efuses.",
