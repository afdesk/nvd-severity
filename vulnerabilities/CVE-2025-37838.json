  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHSI: ssi_protocol: Fix use after free vulnerability in ssi_protocol Driver Due to Race Condition\n\nIn the ssi_protocol_probe() function, &ssi->work is bound with\nssip_xmit_work(), In ssip_pn_setup(), the ssip_pn_xmit() function\nwithin the ssip_pn_ops structure is capable of starting the\nwork.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call ssi_protocol_remove()\nto make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi),\nwhile the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence\nof operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                    CPU1\n\n                        | ssip_xmit_work\nssi_protocol_remove     |\nkfree(ssi);             |\n                        | struct hsi_client *cl = ssi->cl;\n                        | // use ssi\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding\nwith the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove().",
