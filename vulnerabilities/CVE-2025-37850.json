  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npwm: mediatek: Prevent divide-by-zero in pwm_mediatek_config()\n\nWith CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST && !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK, pwm_mediatek_config() has a\ndivide-by-zero in the following line:\n\n\tdo_div(resolution, clk_get_rate(pc->clk_pwms[pwm->hwpwm]));\n\ndue to the fact that the !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK version of clk_get_rate()\nreturns zero.\n\nThis is presumably just a theoretical problem: COMPILE_TEST overrides\nthe dependency on RALINK which would select COMMON_CLK.  Regardless it's\na good idea to check for the error explicitly to avoid divide-by-zero.\n\nFixes the following warning:\n\n  drivers/pwm/pwm-mediatek.o: warning: objtool: .text: unexpected end of section\n\n[ukleinek: s/CONFIG_CLK/CONFIG_HAVE_CLK/]",
