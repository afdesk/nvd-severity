  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: omapfb: Add 'plane' value check\n\nFunction dispc_ovl_setup is not intended to work with the value OMAP_DSS_WB\nof the enum parameter plane.\n\nThe value of this parameter is initialized in dss_init_overlays and in the\ncurrent state of the code it cannot take this value so it's not a real\nproblem.\n\nFor the purposes of defensive coding it wouldn't be superfluous to check\nthe parameter value, because some functions down the call stack process\nthis value correctly and some not.\n\nFor example, in dispc_ovl_setup_global_alpha it may lead to buffer\noverflow.\n\nAdd check for this value.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE static\nanalysis tool.",
