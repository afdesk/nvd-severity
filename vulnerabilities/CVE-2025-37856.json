  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: harden block_group::bg_list against list_del() races\n\nAs far as I can tell, these calls of list_del_init() on bg_list cannot\nrun concurrently with btrfs_mark_bg_unused() or btrfs_mark_bg_to_reclaim(),\nas they are in transaction error paths and situations where the block\ngroup is readonly.\n\nHowever, if there is any chance at all of racing with mark_bg_unused(),\nor a different future user of bg_list, better to be safe than sorry.\n\nOtherwise we risk the following interleaving (bg_list refcount in parens)\n\nT1 (some random op)                       T2 (btrfs_mark_bg_unused)\n                                        !list_empty(&bg->bg_list); (1)\nlist_del_init(&bg->bg_list); (1)\n                                        list_move_tail (1)\nbtrfs_put_block_group (0)\n                                        btrfs_delete_unused_bgs\n                                             bg = list_first_entry\n                                             list_del_init(&bg->bg_list);\n                                             btrfs_put_block_group(bg); (-1)\n\nUltimately, this results in a broken ref count that hits zero one deref\nearly and the real final deref underflows the refcount, resulting in a WARNING.",
