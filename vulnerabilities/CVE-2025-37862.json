  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: pidff: Fix null pointer dereference in pidff_find_fields\n\nThis function triggered a null pointer dereference if used to search for\na report that isn't implemented on the device. This happened both for\noptional and required reports alike.\n\nThe same logic was applied to pidff_find_special_field and although\npidff_init_fields should return an error earlier if one of the required\nreports is missing, future modifications could change this logic and\nresurface this possible null pointer dereference again.\n\nLKML bug report:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/CAL-gK7f5=R0nrrQdPtaZZr1fd-cdAMbDMuZ_NLA8vM0SX+nGSw@mail.gmail.com",
