  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxbf-bootctl: use sysfs_emit_at() in secure_boot_fuse_state_show()\n\nA warning is seen when running the latest kernel on a BlueField SOC:\n[251.512704] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[251.512711] invalid sysfs_emit: buf:0000000003aa32ae\n[251.512720] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 705264 at fs/sysfs/file.c:767 sysfs_emit+0xac/0xc8\n\nThe warning is triggered because the mlxbf-bootctl driver invokes\n\"sysfs_emit()\" with a buffer pointer that is not aligned to the\nstart of the page. The driver should instead use \"sysfs_emit_at()\"\nto support non-zero offsets into the destination buffer.",
