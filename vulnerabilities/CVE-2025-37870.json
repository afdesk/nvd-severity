  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: prevent hang on link training fail\n\n[Why]\nWhen link training fails, the phy clock will be disabled. However, in\nenable_streams, it is assumed that link training succeeded and the\nmux selects the phy clock, causing a hang when a register write is made.\n\n[How]\nWhen enable_stream is hit, check if link training failed. If it did, fall\nback to the ref clock to avoid a hang and keep the system in a recoverable\nstate.",
