  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isn't postable\n\nRestore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the\n*new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU, regardless of\nthe GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an\nMSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.\n\nThe dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to\nthe guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free,\ne.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isn't freed.",
