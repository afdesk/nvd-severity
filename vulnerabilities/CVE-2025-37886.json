  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npds_core: make wait_context part of q_info\n\nMake the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather\nthan a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post()\nis done so that the context is still available after the wait\nloop has given up.\n\nThere was a case where a slow development firmware caused\nthe adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally\nfinished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried\nto complete_all() the completion context that had been created\non the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed.\nThis caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing\nand gnashing of teeth.",
