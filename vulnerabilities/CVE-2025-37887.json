  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npds_core: handle unsupported PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL result\n\nIf the FW doesn't support the PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL command\nthe driver might at the least print garbage and at the worst\ncrash when the user runs the \"devlink dev info\" devlink command.\n\nThis happens because the stack variable fw_list is not 0\ninitialized which results in fw_list.num_fw_slots being a\ngarbage value from the stack.  Then the driver tries to access\nfw_list.fw_names[i] with i >= ARRAY_SIZE and runs off the end\nof the array.\n\nFix this by initializing the fw_list and by not failing\ncompletely if the devcmd fails because other useful information\nis printed via devlink dev info even if the devcmd fails.",
