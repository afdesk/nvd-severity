  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/MSI: Handle the NOMASK flag correctly for all PCI/MSI backends\n\nThe conversion of the XEN specific global variable pci_msi_ignore_mask to a\nMSI domain flag, missed the facts that:\n\n    1) Legacy architectures do not provide a interrupt domain\n    2) Parent MSI domains do not necessarily have a domain info attached\n   \nBoth cases result in an unconditional NULL pointer dereference. This was\nunfortunatly missed in review and testing revealed it late.\n\nCure this by using the existing pci_msi_domain_supports() helper, which\nhandles all possible cases correctly.",
