  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: ets: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc\n\nAs described in Gerrard's report [1], there are use cases where a netem\nchild qdisc will make the parent qdisc's enqueue callback reentrant.\nIn the case of ets, there won't be a UAF, but the code will add the same\nclassifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.\n\nIn addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whether\nthe class was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) before\ndoing the addition to cater for the reentrant case.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/CAHcdcOm+03OD2j6R0=YHKqmy=VgJ8xEOKuP6c7mSgnp-TEJJbw@mail.gmail.com/",
