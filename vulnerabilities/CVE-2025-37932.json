  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsch_htb: make htb_qlen_notify() idempotent\n\nhtb_qlen_notify() always deactivates the HTB class and in fact could\ntrigger a warning if it is already deactivated. Therefore, it is not\nidempotent and not friendly to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue().\n\nLet's make it idempotent to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers'\nlife.",
