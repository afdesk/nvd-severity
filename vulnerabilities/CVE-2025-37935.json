  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix SER panic with 4GB+ RAM\n\nIf the mtk_poll_rx() function detects the MTK_RESETTING flag, it will\njump to release_desc and refill the high word of the SDP on the 4GB RFB.\nSubsequently, mtk_rx_clean will process an incorrect SDP, leading to a\npanic.\n\nAdd patch from MediaTek's SDK to resolve this.",
