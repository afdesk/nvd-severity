  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nftrace: Add cond_resched() to ftrace_graph_set_hash()\n\nWhen the kernel contains a large number of functions that can be traced,\nthe loop in ftrace_graph_set_hash() may take a lot of time to execute.\nThis may trigger the softlockup watchdog.\n\nAdd cond_resched() within the loop to allow the kernel to remain\nresponsive even when processing a large number of functions.\n\nThis matches the cond_resched() that is used in other locations of the\ncode that iterates over all functions that can be traced.",
