  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: typec: ucsi: displayport: Fix deadlock\n\nThis patch introduces the ucsi_con_mutex_lock / ucsi_con_mutex_unlock\nfunctions to the UCSI driver. ucsi_con_mutex_lock ensures the connector\nmutex is only locked if a connection is established and the partner pointer\nis valid. This resolves a deadlock scenario where\nucsi_displayport_remove_partner holds con->mutex waiting for\ndp_altmode_work to complete while dp_altmode_work attempts to acquire it.",
