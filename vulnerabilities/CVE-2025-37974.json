  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/pci: Fix missing check for zpci_create_device() error return\n\nThe zpci_create_device() function returns an error pointer that needs to\nbe checked before dereferencing it as a struct zpci_dev pointer. Add the\nmissing check in __clp_add() where it was missed when adding the\nscan_list in the fixed commit. Simply not adding the device to the scan\nlist results in the previous behavior.",
