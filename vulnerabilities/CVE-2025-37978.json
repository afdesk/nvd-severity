  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: integrity: Do not call set_page_dirty_lock()\n\nPlacing multiple protection information buffers inside the same page\ncan lead to oopses because set_page_dirty_lock() can't be called from\ninterrupt context.\n\nSince a protection information buffer is not backed by a file there is\nno point in setting its page dirty, there is nothing to synchronize.\nDrop the call to set_page_dirty_lock() and remove the last argument to\nbio_integrity_unpin_bvec().",
