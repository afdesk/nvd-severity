  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcm80211: fmac: Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()\n\nThe function brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage() calls the function\nbrcmf_usb_dl_cmd() but dose not check its return value. The\n'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized if the\nfunction brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails. It is dangerous to use\nuninitialized variables in the conditions.\n\nAdd error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() to jump to error\nhandling path if the brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails and the\n'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized.\n\nImprove the error message to report more detailed error\ninformation.",
