  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: Flush gso_skb list too during ->change()\n\nPreviously, when reducing a qdisc's limit via the ->change() operation, only\nthe main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb\nlist. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check\nsch->limit against sch->q.qlen.\n\nThis patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensures\nboth the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming\nexcess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie)\nare updated to use this helper in their ->change() routines.",
