  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmodule: ensure that kobject_put() is safe for module type kobjects\n\nIn 'lookup_or_create_module_kobject()', an internal kobject is created\nusing 'module_ktype'. So call to 'kobject_put()' on error handling\npath causes an attempt to use an uninitialized completion pointer in\n'module_kobject_release()'. In this scenario, we just want to release\nkobject without an extra synchronization required for a regular module\nunloading process, so adding an extra check whether 'complete()' is\nactually required makes 'kobject_put()' safe.",
