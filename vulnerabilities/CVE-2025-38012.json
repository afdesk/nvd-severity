  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched_ext: bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() should always initialize iterator\n\nBPF programs may call next() and destroy() on BPF iterators even after new()\nreturns an error value (e.g. bpf_for_each() macro ignores error returns from\nnew()). bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() could leave the iterator in an uninitialized\nstate after an error return causing bpf_iter_scx_dsq_next() to dereference\ngarbage data. Make bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() always clear $kit->dsq so that\nnext() and destroy() become noops.",
