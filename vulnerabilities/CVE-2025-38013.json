  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: Set n_channels after allocating struct cfg80211_scan_request\n\nMake sure that n_channels is set after allocating the\nstruct cfg80211_registered_device::int_scan_req member. Seen with\nsyzkaller:\n\nUBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in net/mac80211/scan.c:1208:5\nindex 0 is out of range for type 'struct ieee80211_channel *[] __counted_by(n_channels)' (aka 'struct ieee80211_channel *[]')\n\nThis was missed in the initial conversions because I failed to locate\nthe allocation likely due to the \"sizeof(void *)\" not matching the\n\"channels\" array type.",
