  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/eventpoll: fix endless busy loop after timeout has expired\n\nAfter commit 0a65bc27bd64 (\"eventpoll: Set epoll timeout if it's in\nthe future\"), the following program would immediately enter a busy\nloop in the kernel:\n\n```\nint main() {\n  int e = epoll_create1(0);\n  struct epoll_event event = {.events = EPOLLIN};\n  epoll_ctl(e, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 0, &event);\n  const struct timespec timeout = {.tv_nsec = 1};\n  epoll_pwait2(e, &event, 1, &timeout, 0);\n}\n```\n\nThis happens because the given (non-zero) timeout of 1 nanosecond\nusually expires before ep_poll() is entered and then\nep_schedule_timeout() returns false, but `timed_out` is never set\nbecause the code line that sets it is skipped.  This quickly turns\ninto a soft lockup, RCU stalls and deadlocks, inflicting severe\nheadaches to the whole system.\n\nWhen the timeout has expired, we don't need to schedule a hrtimer, but\nwe should set the `timed_out` variable.  Therefore, I suggest moving\nthe ep_schedule_timeout() check into the `timed_out` expression\ninstead of skipping it.\n\nbrauner: Note that there was an earlier fix by Joe Damato in response to\nmy bug report in [1].",
