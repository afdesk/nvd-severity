  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: sunxi-ng: h616: Reparent GPU clock during frequency changes\n\nThe H616 manual does not state that the GPU PLL supports\ndynamic frequency configuration, so we must take extra care when changing\nthe frequency. Currently any attempt to do device DVFS on the GPU lead\nto panfrost various ooops, and GPU hangs.\n\nThe manual describes the algorithm for changing the PLL\nfrequency, which the CPU PLL notifier code already support, so we reuse\nthat to reparent the GPU clock to GPU1 clock during frequency\nchanges.",
