  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nptp: ocp: Limit signal/freq counts in summary output functions\n\nThe debugfs summary output could access uninitialized elements in\nthe freq_in[] and signal_out[] arrays, causing NULL pointer\ndereferences and triggering a kernel Oops (page_fault_oops).\nThis patch adds u8 fields (nr_freq_in, nr_signal_out) to track the\nnumber of initialized elements, with a maximum of 4 per array.\nThe summary output functions are updated to respect these limits,\npreventing out-of-bounds access and ensuring safe array handling.\n\nWiden the label variables because the change confuses GCC about\nmax length of the strings.",
