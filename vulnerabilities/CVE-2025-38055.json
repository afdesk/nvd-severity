  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel: Fix segfault with PEBS-via-PT with sample_freq\n\nCurrently, using PEBS-via-PT with a sample frequency instead of a sample\nperiod, causes a segfault.  For example:\n\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000195\n    <NMI>\n    ? __die_body.cold+0x19/0x27\n    ? page_fault_oops+0xca/0x290\n    ? exc_page_fault+0x7e/0x1b0\n    ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n    ? intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain+0x40/0x60\n    ? intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain+0x32/0x60\n    intel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl+0x333/0x350\n    handle_pmi_common+0x272/0x3c0\n    intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x10a/0x2e0\n    perf_event_nmi_handler+0x2a/0x50\n\nThat happens because intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain() assumes all the\npebs_enabled bits represent counter indexes, which is not always the case.\nIn this particular case, bits 60 and 61 are set for PEBS-via-PT purposes.\n\nThe behaviour of PEBS-via-PT with sample frequency is questionable because\nalthough a PMI is generated (PEBS_PMI_AFTER_EACH_RECORD), the period is not\nadjusted anyway.\n\nPutting that aside, fix intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain() by passing\nthe mask of counter bits instead of 'size'.  Note, prior to the Fixes\ncommit, 'size' would be limited to the maximum counter index, so the issue\nwas not hit.",
