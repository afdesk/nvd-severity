  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\n__legitimize_mnt(): check for MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT should be under mount_lock\n\n... or we risk stealing final mntput from sync umount - raising mnt_count\nafter umount(2) has verified that victim is not busy, but before it\nhas set MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT; in that case __legitimize_mnt() doesn't see\nthat it's safe to quietly undo mnt_count increment and leaves dropping\nthe reference to caller, where it'll be a full-blown mntput().\n\nCheck under mount_lock is needed; leaving the current one done before\ntaking that makes no sense - it's nowhere near common enough to bother\nwith.",
