  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm: Check return value from memblock_phys_alloc_range()\n\nAt least with CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000, if there is < 4 MiB of\ncontiguous free memory available at this point, the kernel will crash\nand burn because memblock_phys_alloc_range() returns 0 on failure,\nwhich leads memblock_phys_free() to throw the first 4 MiB of physical\nmemory to the wolves.\n\nAt a minimum it should fail gracefully with a meaningful diagnostic,\nbut in fact everything seems to work fine without the weird reserve\nallocation.",
