  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: cadence: macb: Fix a possible deadlock in macb_halt_tx.\n\nThere is a situation where after THALT is set high, TGO stays high as\nwell. Because jiffies are never updated, as we are in a context with\ninterrupts disabled, we never exit that loop and have a deadlock.\n\nThat deadlock was noticed on a sama5d4 device that stayed locked for days.\n\nUse retries instead of jiffies so that the timeout really works and we do\nnot have a deadlock anymore.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN",
