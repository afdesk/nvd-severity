  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: usbhid: Eliminate recurrent out-of-bounds bug in usbhid_parse()\n\nUpdate struct hid_descriptor to better reflect the mandatory and\noptional parts of the HID Descriptor as per USB HID 1.11 specification.\nNote: the kernel currently does not parse any optional HID class\ndescriptors, only the mandatory report descriptor.\n\nUpdate all references to member element desc[0] to rpt_desc.\n\nAdd test to verify bLength and bNumDescriptors values are valid.\n\nReplace the for loop with direct access to the mandatory HID class\ndescriptor member for the report descriptor. This eliminates the\npossibility of getting an out-of-bounds fault.\n\nAdd a warning message if the HID descriptor contains any unsupported\noptional HID class descriptors.",
