  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: ets: fix a race in ets_qdisc_change()\n\nGerrard Tai reported a race condition in ETS, whenever SFQ perturb timer\nfires at the wrong time.\n\nThe race is as follows:\n\nCPU 0                                 CPU 1\n[1]: lock root\n[2]: qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()\n[3]: unlock root\n |\n |                                    [5]: lock root\n |                                    [6]: rehash\n |                                    [7]: qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()\n |\n[4]: qdisc_put()\n\nThis can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen.\n\nCalling qdisc_purge_queue() instead of qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()\nshould fix the race, because all packets will be purged from the qdisc\nbefore releasing the lock.",
