  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: Fix TOCTOU issue in sk_is_readable()\n\nsk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable is a valid function pointer when sk resides\nin a sockmap. After the last sk_psock_put() (which usually happens when\nsocket is removed from sockmap), sk->sk_prot gets restored and\nsk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable becomes NULL.\n\nThis makes sk_is_readable() racy, if the value of sk->sk_prot is reloaded\nafter the initial check. Which in turn may lead to a null pointer\ndereference.\n\nEnsure the function pointer does not turn NULL after the check.",
