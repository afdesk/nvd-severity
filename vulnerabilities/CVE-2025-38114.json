  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ne1000: Move cancel_work_sync to avoid deadlock\n\nPreviously, e1000_down called cancel_work_sync for the e1000 reset task\n(via e1000_down_and_stop), which takes RTNL.\n\nAs reported by users and syzbot, a deadlock is possible in the following\nscenario:\n\nCPU 0:\n  - RTNL is held\n  - e1000_close\n  - e1000_down\n  - cancel_work_sync (cancel / wait for e1000_reset_task())\n\nCPU 1:\n  - process_one_work\n  - e1000_reset_task\n  - take RTNL\n\nTo remedy this, avoid calling cancel_work_sync from e1000_down\n(e1000_reset_task does nothing if the device is down anyway). Instead,\ncall cancel_work_sync for e1000_reset_task when the device is being\nremoved.",
