  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngve: add missing NULL check for gve_alloc_pending_packet() in TX DQO\n\ngve_alloc_pending_packet() can return NULL, but gve_tx_add_skb_dqo()\ndid not check for this case before dereferencing the returned pointer.\n\nAdd a missing NULL check to prevent a potential NULL pointer\ndereference when allocation fails.\n\nThis improves robustness in low-memory scenarios.",
