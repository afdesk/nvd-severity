However, in the logic of processing skb in\npolling, an invalid netdev is still being used, which causes a panic.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000f1\nOops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\nRIP: 0010:dev_gro_receive+0x3a/0x620\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <IRQ>\n ? __die_body+0x68/0xb0\n ? page_fault_oops+0x379/0x3e0\n ? exc_page_fault+0x4f/0xa0\n ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n ? __pfx_t7xx_ccmni_recv_skb+0x10/0x10 [mtk_t7xx (HASH:1400 7)]\n ? dev_gro_receive+0x3a/0x620\n napi_gro_receive+0xad/0x170\n t7xx_ccmni_recv_skb+0x48/0x70 [mtk_t7xx (HASH:1400 7)]\n t7xx_dpmaif_napi_rx_poll+0x590/0x800 [mtk_t7xx (HASH:1400 7)]\n net_rx_action+0x103/0x470\n irq_exit_rcu+0x13a/0x310\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x56/0x90\n </IRQ>",
