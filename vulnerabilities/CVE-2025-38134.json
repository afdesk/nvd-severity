  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: acpi: Prevent null pointer dereference in usb_acpi_add_usb4_devlink()\n\nAs demonstrated by the fix for update_port_device_state,\ncommit 12783c0b9e2c (\"usb: core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_state\"),\nusb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL in certain scenarios,\nsuch as during hub driver unbind or teardown race conditions,\neven if the underlying usb_device structure exists.\n\nPlus, all other places that call usb_hub_to_struct_hub() in the same file\ndo check for NULL return values.\n\nIf usb_hub_to_struct_hub() returns NULL, the subsequent access to\nhub->ports[udev->portnum - 1] will cause a null pointer dereference.",
