  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (asus-ec-sensors) check sensor index in read_string()\n\nPrevent a potential invalid memory access when the requested sensor\nis not found.\n\nfind_ec_sensor_index() may return a negative value (e.g. -ENOENT),\nbut its result was used without checking, which could lead to\nundefined behavior when passed to get_sensor_info().\n\nAdd a proper check to return -EINVAL if sensor_index is negative.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.\n\n[groeck: Return error code returned from find_ec_sensor_index]",
