  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted\n\nThere is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the\nnetwork port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls\ndevice_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear\nphydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the\nnetwork port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before\ncalling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the \"error\" label and\ncalls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from\nthe previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,\nwhich accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash\nlog is as follows.\n\n[   24.702421] Call trace:\n[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120\n[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48\n[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168\n[   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4\n[   24.720352]  phylink_fwnode_phy_connect+0xc8/0x14c\n[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34\n\nTherefore, phydev->devlink needs to be cleared when the device link is\ndeleted.",
