  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls\n\nSyzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in\naqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'\nresults. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit\n920a9fa27e78 (\"net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors\").\n\nFor instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes,\neven if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd()\nwill not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead\nto MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized,\ntriggering KMSAN warnings.\n\nFix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is\nas expected and not less.\n\n[1] Partial syzbot report:\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in is_valid_ether_addr include/linux/etherdevice.h:208 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in usbnet_probe+0x2e57/0x4390 drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c:1830\n is_valid_ether_addr include/linux/etherdevice.h:208 [inline]\n usbnet_probe+0x2e57/0x4390 drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c:1830\n usb_probe_interface+0xd01/0x1310 drivers/usb/core/driver.c:396\n call_driver_probe drivers/base/dd.c:-1 [inline]\n really_probe+0x4d1/0xd90 drivers/base/dd.c:658\n __driver_probe_device+0x268/0x380 drivers/base/dd.c:800\n...\n\nUninit was stored to memory at:\n dev_addr_mod+0xb0/0x550 net/core/dev_addr_lists.c:582\n __dev_addr_set include/linux/netdevice.h:4874 [inline]\n eth_hw_addr_set include/linux/etherdevice.h:325 [inline]\n aqc111_bind+0x35f/0x1150 drivers/net/usb/aqc111.c:717\n usbnet_probe+0xbe6/0x4390 drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c:1772\n usb_probe_interface+0xd01/0x1310 drivers/usb/core/driver.c:396\n...\n\nUninit was stored to memory at:\n ether_addr_copy include/linux/etherdevice.h:305 [inline]\n aqc111_read_perm_mac drivers/net/usb/aqc111.c:663 [inline]\n aqc111_bind+0x794/0x1150 drivers/net/usb/aqc111.c:713\n usbnet_probe+0xbe6/0x4390 drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c:1772\n usb_probe_interface+0xd01/0x1310 drivers/usb/core/driver.c:396\n call_driver_probe drivers/base/dd.c:-1 [inline]\n...\n\nLocal variable buf.i created at:\n aqc111_read_perm_mac drivers/net/usb/aqc111.c:656 [inline]\n aqc111_bind+0x221/0x1150 drivers/net/usb/aqc111.c:713\n usbnet_probe+0xbe6/0x4390 drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c:1772",
