  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthunderbolt: Do not double dequeue a configuration request\n\nSome of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue():\n\n general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122\n\n CPU: 6 PID: 91007 Comm: kworker/6:2 Tainted: G U W 6.6.65\n RIP: 0010:tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0\n Call Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0\n tb_cfg_request_work+0x33/0x80\n worker_thread+0x386/0x8f0\n kthread+0xed/0x110\n ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n\nThe circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is that\ntb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request:\nfirst time via frame.callback from ring_work() and second\ntime from tb_cfg_request().  Both times kworkers will execute\ntb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del()\nfrom the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hints\nat it: 0xdead000000000122).\n\nDo not dequeue requests that don't have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVE\nbit set.",
