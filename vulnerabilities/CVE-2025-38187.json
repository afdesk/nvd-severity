  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau: fix a use-after-free in r535_gsp_rpc_push()\n\nThe RPC container is released after being passed to r535_gsp_rpc_send().\n\nWhen sending the initial fragment of a large RPC and passing the\ncaller's RPC container, the container will be freed prematurely. Subsequent\nattempts to send remaining fragments will therefore result in a\nuse-after-free.\n\nAllocate a temporary RPC container for holding the initial fragment of a\nlarge RPC when sending. Free the caller's container when all fragments\nare successfully sent.\n\n[ Rebase onto Blackwell changes. - Danilo ]",
