  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\natm: Revert atm_account_tx() if copy_from_iter_full() fails.\n\nIn vcc_sendmsg(), we account skb->truesize to sk->sk_wmem_alloc by\natm_account_tx().\n\nIt is expected to be reverted by atm_pop_raw() later called by\nvcc->dev->ops->send(vcc, skb).\n\nHowever, vcc_sendmsg() misses the same revert when copy_from_iter_full()\nfails, and then we will leak a socket.\n\nLet's factorise the revert part as atm_return_tx() and call it in\nthe failure path.\n\nNote that the corresponding sk_wmem_alloc operation can be found in\nalloc_tx() as of the blamed commit.\n\n  $ git blame -L:alloc_tx net/atm/common.c c55fa3cccbc2c~",
