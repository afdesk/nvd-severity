  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbcon: Make sure modelist not set on unregistered console\n\nIt looks like attempting to write to the \"store_modes\" sysfs node will\nrun afoul of unregistered consoles:\n\nUBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:122:28\nindex -1 is out of range for type 'fb_info *[32]'\n...\n fbcon_info_from_console+0x192/0x1a0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:122\n fbcon_new_modelist+0xbf/0x2d0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbcon.c:3048\n fb_new_modelist+0x328/0x440 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c:673\n store_modes+0x1c9/0x3e0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbsysfs.c:113\n dev_attr_store+0x55/0x80 drivers/base/core.c:2439\n\nstatic struct fb_info *fbcon_registered_fb[FB_MAX];\n...\nstatic signed char con2fb_map[MAX_NR_CONSOLES];\n...\nstatic struct fb_info *fbcon_info_from_console(int console)\n...\n        return fbcon_registered_fb[con2fb_map[console]];\n\nIf con2fb_map contains a -1 things go wrong here. Instead, return NULL,\nas callers of fbcon_info_from_console() are trying to compare against\nexisting \"info\" pointers, so error handling should kick in correctly.",
