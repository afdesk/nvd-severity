  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Check rcu_read_lock_trace_held() in bpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem()\n\nbpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem() helper is also available for sleepable bpf\nprogram. When BPF JIT is disabled or under 32-bit host,\nbpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem() will not be inlined. Using it in a\nsleepable bpf program will trigger the warning in\nbpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem(), because the bpf program only holds\nrcu_read_lock_trace lock. Therefore, add the missed check.",
