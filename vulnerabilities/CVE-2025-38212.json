  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipc: fix to protect IPCS lookups using RCU\n\nsyzbot reported that it discovered a use-after-free vulnerability, [0]\n\n[0]: https://lore.kernel.org/all/67af13f8.050a0220.21dd3.0038.GAE@google.com/\n\nidr_for_each() is protected by rwsem, but this is not enough.  If it is\nnot protected by RCU read-critical region, when idr_for_each() calls\nradix_tree_node_free() through call_rcu() to free the radix_tree_node\nstructure, the node will be freed immediately, and when reading the next\nnode in radix_tree_for_each_slot(), the already freed memory may be read.\n\nTherefore, we need to add code to make sure that idr_for_each() is\nprotected within the RCU read-critical region when we call it in\nshm_destroy_orphaned().",
