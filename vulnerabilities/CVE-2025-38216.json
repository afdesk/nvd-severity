  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices\n\nCommit 2031c469f816 (\"iommu/vt-d: Add support for static identity domain\")\nchanged the context entry setup during domain attachment from a\nset-and-check policy to a clear-and-reset approach. This inadvertently\nintroduced a regression affecting PCI aliased devices behind PCIe-to-PCI\nbridges.\n\nSpecifically, keyboard and touchpad stopped working on several Apple\nMacbooks with below messages:\n\n kernel: platform pxa2xx-spi.3: Adding to iommu group 20\n kernel: input: Apple SPI Keyboard as\n /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.3/pxa2xx-spi.3/spi_master/spi2/spi-APP000D:00/input/input0\n kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3\n kernel: DMAR: [DMA Read NO_PASID] Request device [00:1e.3] fault addr\n 0xffffa000 [fault reason 0x06] PTE Read access is not set\n kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3\n kernel: DMAR: [DMA Read NO_PASID] Request device [00:1e.3] fault addr\n 0xffffa000 [fault reason 0x06] PTE Read access is not set\n kernel: applespi spi-APP000D:00: Error writing to device: 01 0e 00 00\n kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3\n kernel: DMAR: [DMA Read NO_PASID] Request device [00:1e.3] fault addr\n 0xffffa000 [fault reason 0x06] PTE Read access is not set\n kernel: DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 3\n kernel: applespi spi-APP000D:00: Error writing to device: 01 0e 00 00\n\nFix this by restoring the previous context setup order.",
