  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereference\n\nIn nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc through\nnfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isn't initialized,\nthis can cause NULL pointer dereference.\n\nNormally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time for\nnfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits too\nlong for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net ->\nnfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done ->\ncld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), the\ndelayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes.\n\nFix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work.",
