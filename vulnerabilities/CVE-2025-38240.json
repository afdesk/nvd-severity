  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: dp: drm_err => dev_err in HPD path to avoid NULL ptr\n\nThe function mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted() may be called before the\n`mtk_dp->drm_dev` pointer is assigned in mtk_dp_bridge_attach().\nSpecifically it can be called via this callpath:\n - mtk_edp_wait_hpd_asserted\n - [panel probe]\n - dp_aux_ep_probe\n\nUsing \"drm\" level prints anywhere in this callpath causes a NULL\npointer dereference. Change the error message directly in\nmtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted() to dev_err() to avoid this. Also change the\nerror messages in mtk_dp_parse_capabilities(), which is called by\nmtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted().\n\nWhile touching these prints, also add the error code to them to make\nfuture debugging easier.",
