  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay\n\nIn a few places where we call read_one_inode(), if we get a NULL pointer\nwe end up jumping into an error path, or fallthrough in case of\n__add_inode_ref(), where we then do something like this:\n\n   iput(&inode->vfs_inode);\n\nwhich results in an invalid inode pointer that triggers an invalid memory\naccess, resulting in a crash.\n\nFix this by making sure we don't do such dereferences.",
