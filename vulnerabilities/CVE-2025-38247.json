  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuserns and mnt_idmap leak in open_tree_attr(2)\n\nOnce want_mount_setattr() has returned a positive, it does require\nfinish_mount_kattr() to release ->mnt_userns.  Failing do_mount_setattr()\ndoes not change that.\n\nAs the result, we can end up leaking userns and possibly mnt_idmap as\nwell.",
