  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion\n\nBy inspection, cxl_cper_handle_prot_err() is making a series of fragile\nassumptions that can lead to crashes:\n\n1/ It assumes that endpoints identified in the record are a CXL-type-3\n   device, nothing guarantees that.\n\n2/ It assumes that the device is bound to the cxl_pci driver, nothing\n   guarantees that.\n\n3/ Minor, it holds the device lock over the switch-port tracing for no\n   reason as the trace is 100% generated from data in the record.\n\nCorrect those by checking that the PCIe endpoint parents a cxl_memdev\nbefore assuming the format of the driver data, and move the lock to where\nit is required. Consequently this also makes the implementation ready for\nCXL accelerators that are not bound to cxl_pci.",
