  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: wacom: fix crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()\n\nCommit fd2a9b29dc9c (\"HID: wacom: Remove AES power_supply after extended\ninactivity\") introduced wacom_aes_battery_handler() which is scheduled\nas a delayed work (aes_battery_work).\n\nIn wacom_remove(), aes_battery_work is not canceled. Consequently, if\nthe device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending, then hard\ncrashes or \"Oops: general protection fault...\" are experienced when\nwacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called. E.g., this happens with\nbuilt-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work\nwas still pending at the time of hibernation.\n\nSo, take care to cancel aes_battery_work in wacom_remove().",
