  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()\n\nWhen EDID is retrieved via drm_edid_raw(), it doesn't guarantee to\nreturn proper EDID bytes the caller wants: it may be either NULL (that\nleads to an Oops) or with too long bytes over the fixed size raw_edid\narray (that may lead to memory corruption).  The latter was reported\nactually when connected with a bad adapter.\n\nAdd sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner\ncases, and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)",
