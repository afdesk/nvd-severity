  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/pkey: Prevent overflow in size calculation for memdup_user()\n\nNumber of apqn target list entries contained in 'nr_apqns' variable is\ndetermined by userspace via an ioctl call so the result of the product in\ncalculation of size passed to memdup_user() may overflow.\n\nIn this case the actual size of the allocated area and the value\ndescribing it won't be in sync leading to various types of unpredictable\nbehaviour later.\n\nUse a proper memdup_array_user() helper which returns an error if an\noverflow is detected. Note that it is different from when nr_apqns is\ninitially zero - that case is considered valid and should be handled in\nsubsequent pkey_handler implementations.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org).",
