  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: serial: uartlite: register uart driver in init\n\nWhen two instances of uart devices are probing, a concurrency race can\noccur. If one thread calls uart_register_driver function, which first\nallocates and assigns memory to 'uart_state' member of uart_driver\nstructure, the other instance can bypass uart driver registration and\ncall ulite_assign. This calls uart_add_one_port, which expects the uart\ndriver to be fully initialized. This leads to a kernel panic due to a\nnull pointer dereference:\n\n[    8.143581] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000002b8\n[    8.156982] #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\n[    8.156984] #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page\n[    8.156986] PGD 0 P4D 0\n...\n[    8.180668] RIP: 0010:mutex_lock+0x19/0x30\n[    8.188624] Call Trace:\n[    8.188629]  ? __die_body.cold+0x1a/0x1f\n[    8.195260]  ? page_fault_oops+0x15c/0x290\n[    8.209183]  ? __irq_resolve_mapping+0x47/0x80\n[    8.209187]  ? exc_page_fault+0x64/0x140\n[    8.209190]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n[    8.209196]  ? mutex_lock+0x19/0x30\n[    8.223116]  uart_add_one_port+0x60/0x440\n[    8.223122]  ? proc_tty_register_driver+0x43/0x50\n[    8.223126]  ? tty_register_driver+0x1ca/0x1e0\n[    8.246250]  ulite_probe+0x357/0x4b0 [uartlite]\n\nTo prevent it, move uart driver registration in to init function.
