  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: exit after state insertion failure at btrfs_convert_extent_bit()\n\nIf insert_state() state failed it returns an error pointer and we call\nextent_io_tree_panic() which will trigger a BUG() call. However if\nCONFIG_BUG is disabled, which is an uncommon and exotic scenario, then\nwe fallthrough and call cache_state() which will dereference the error\npointer, resulting in an invalid memory access.\n\nSo jump to the 'out' label after calling extent_io_tree_panic(), it also\nmakes the code more clear besides dealing with the exotic scenario where\nCONFIG_BUG is disabled.",
