  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: tipc: fix refcount warning in tipc_aead_encrypt\n\nsyzbot reported a refcount warning [1] caused by calling get_net() on\na network namespace that is being destroyed (refcount=0). This happens\nwhen a TIPC discovery timer fires during network namespace cleanup.\n\nThe recently added get_net() call in commit e279024617134 (\"net/tipc:\nfix slab-use-after-free Read in tipc_aead_encrypt_done\") attempts to\nhold a reference to the network namespace. However, if the namespace\nis already being destroyed, its refcount might be zero, leading to the\nuse-after-free warning.\n\nReplace get_net() with maybe_get_net(), which safely checks if the\nrefcount is non-zero before incrementing it. If the namespace is being\ndestroyed, return -ENODEV early, after releasing the bearer reference.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/all/68342b55.a70a0220.253bc2.0091.GAE@google.com/T/#m12019cf9ae77e1954f666914640efa36d52704a2",
