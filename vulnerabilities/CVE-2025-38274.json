  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfpga: fix potential null pointer deref in fpga_mgr_test_img_load_sgt()\n\nfpga_mgr_test_img_load_sgt() allocates memory for sgt using\nkunit_kzalloc() however it does not check if the allocation failed.\nIt then passes sgt to sg_alloc_table(), which passes it to\n__sg_alloc_table(). This function calls memset() on sgt in an attempt to\nzero it out. If the allocation fails then sgt will be NULL and the\nmemset will trigger a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFix this by checking the allocation with KUNIT_ASSERT_NOT_ERR_OR_NULL().",
