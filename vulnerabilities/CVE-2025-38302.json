  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: don't use submit_bio_noacct_nocheck in blk_zone_wplug_bio_work\n\nBios queued up in the zone write plug have already gone through all all\npreparation in the submit_bio path, including the freeze protection.\n\nSubmitting them through submit_bio_noacct_nocheck duplicates the work\nand can can cause deadlocks when freezing a queue with pending bio\nwrite plugs.\n\nGo straight to ->submit_bio or blk_mq_submit_bio to bypass the\nsuperfluous extra freeze protection and checks.",
