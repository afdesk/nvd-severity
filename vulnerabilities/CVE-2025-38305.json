  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nptp: remove ptp->n_vclocks check logic in ptp_vclock_in_use()\n\nThere is no disagreement that we should check both ptp->is_virtual_clock\nand ptp->n_vclocks to check if the ptp virtual clock is in use.\n\nHowever, when we acquire ptp->n_vclocks_mux to read ptp->n_vclocks in\nptp_vclock_in_use(), we observe a recursive lock in the call trace\nstarting from n_vclocks_store().\n\n============================================\nWARNING: possible recursive locking detected\n6.15.0-rc6 #1 Not tainted\n--------------------------------------------\nsyz.0.1540/13807 is trying to acquire lock:\nffff888035a24868 (&ptp->n_vclocks_mux){+.+.}-{4:4}, at:\n ptp_vclock_in_use drivers/ptp/ptp_private.h:103 [inline]\nffff888035a24868 (&ptp->n_vclocks_mux){+.+.}-{4:4}, at:\n ptp_clock_unregister+0x21/0x250 drivers/ptp/ptp_clock.c:415\n\nbut task is already holding lock:\nffff888030704868 (&ptp->n_vclocks_mux){+.+.}-{4:4}, at:\n n_vclocks_store+0xf1/0x6d0 drivers/ptp/ptp_sysfs.c:215\n\nother info that might help us debug this:\n Possible unsafe locking scenario:\n\n       CPU0\n       ----\n  lock(&ptp->n_vclocks_mux);\n  lock(&ptp->n_vclocks_mux);\n\n *** DEADLOCK ***\n....\n============================================\n\nThe best way to solve this is to remove the logic that checks\nptp->n_vclocks in ptp_vclock_in_use().\n\nThe reason why this is appropriate is that any path that uses\nptp->n_vclocks must unconditionally check if ptp->n_vclocks is greater\nthan 0 before unregistering vclocks, and all functions are already\nwritten this way. And in the function that uses ptp->n_vclocks, we\nalready get ptp->n_vclocks_mux before unregistering vclocks.\n\nTherefore, we need to remove the redundant check for ptp->n_vclocks in\nptp_vclock_in_use() to prevent recursive locking.",
