  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/fhandle.c: fix a race in call of has_locked_children()\n\nmay_decode_fh() is calling has_locked_children() while holding no locks.\nThat's an oopsable race...\n\nThe rest of the callers are safe since they are holding namespace_sem and\nare guaranteed a positive refcount on the mount in question.\n\nRename the current has_locked_children() to __has_locked_children(), make\nit static and switch the fs/namespace.c users to it.\n\nMake has_locked_children() a wrapper for __has_locked_children(), calling\nthe latter under read_seqlock_excl(&mount_lock).",
