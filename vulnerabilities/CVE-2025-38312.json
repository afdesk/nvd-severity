  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: core: fbcvt: avoid division by 0 in fb_cvt_hperiod()\n\nIn fb_find_mode_cvt(), iff mode->refresh somehow happens to be 0x80000000,\ncvt.f_refresh will become 0 when multiplying it by 2 due to overflow. It's\nthen passed to fb_cvt_hperiod(), where it's used as a divider -- division\nby 0 will result in kernel oops. Add a sanity check for cvt.f_refresh to\navoid such overflow...\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace static\nanalysis tool.",
