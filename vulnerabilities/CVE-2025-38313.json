  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: fsl-mc: fix double-free on mc_dev\n\nThe blamed commit tried to simplify how the deallocations are done but,\nin the process, introduced a double-free on the mc_dev variable.\n\nIn case the MC device is a DPRC, a new mc_bus is allocated and the\nmc_dev variable is just a reference to one of its fields. In this\ncircumstance, on the error path only the mc_bus should be freed.\n\nThis commit introduces back the following checkpatch warning which is a\nfalse-positive.\n\nWARNING: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required\n+       if (mc_bus)\n+               kfree(mc_bus);",
