  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: Log an error when close_all_cached_dirs fails\n\nUnder low-memory conditions, close_all_cached_dirs() can't move the\ndentries to a separate list to dput() them once the locks are dropped.\nThis will result in a \"Dentry still in use\" error, so add an error\nmessage that makes it clear this is what happened:\n\n[  495.281119] CIFS: VFS: \\\\otters.example.com\\share Out of memory while dropping dentries\n[  495.281595] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  495.281887] BUG: Dentry ffff888115531138{i=78,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]\n[  495.282391] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2329 at fs/dcache.c:1536 umount_check+0xc8/0xf0\n\nAlso, bail out of looping through all tcons as soon as a single\nallocation fails, since we're already in trouble, and kmalloc() attempts\nfor subseqeuent tcons are likely to fail just like the first one did.",
