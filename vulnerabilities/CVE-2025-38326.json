  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naoe: clean device rq_list in aoedev_downdev()\n\nAn aoe device's rq_list contains accepted block requests that are\nwaiting to be transmitted to the aoe target. This queue was added as\npart of the conversion to blk_mq. However, the queue was not cleaned out\nwhen an aoe device is downed which caused blk_mq_freeze_queue() to sleep\nindefinitely waiting for those requests to complete, causing a hang. This\nfix cleans out the queue before calling blk_mq_freeze_queue().",
