  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS version\n\nThe strlcat() with FORTIFY support is triggering a panic because it\nthinks the target buffer will overflow although the correct target\nbuffer size is passed in.\n\nAnyway, instead of memset() with 0 followed by a strlcat(), just use\nmemcpy() and ensure that the resulting buffer is NULL terminated.\n\nBIOSVersion is only used for the lpfc_printf_log() which expects a\nproperly terminated string.",
