  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nata: pata_via: Force PIO for ATAPI devices on VT6415/VT6330\n\nThe controller has a hardware bug that can hard hang the system when\ndoing ATAPI DMAs without any trace of what happened. Depending on the\ndevice attached, it can also prevent the system from booting.\n\nIn this case, the system hangs when reading the ATIP from optical media\nwith cdrecord -vvv -atip on an _NEC DVD_RW ND-4571A 1-01 and an\nOptiarc DVD RW AD-7200A 1.06 attached to an ASRock 990FX Extreme 4,\nrunning at UDMA/33.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced by running the same command with a cygwin\nbuild of cdrecord on WinXP, although it requires more attempts to cause\nit. The hang in that case is also resolved by forcing PIO. It doesn't\nappear that VIA has produced any drivers for that OS, thus no known\nworkaround exists.\n\nHDDs attached to the controller do not suffer from any DMA issues.",
