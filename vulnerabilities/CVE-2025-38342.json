  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoftware node: Correct a OOB check in software_node_get_reference_args()\n\nsoftware_node_get_reference_args() wants to get @index-th element, so\nthe property value requires at least '(index + 1) * sizeof(*ref)' bytes\nbut that can not be guaranteed by current OOB check, and may cause OOB\nfor malformed property.\n\nFix by using as OOB check '((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length)'.",
