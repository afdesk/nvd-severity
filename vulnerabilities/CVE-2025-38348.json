  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: p54: prevent buffer-overflow in p54_rx_eeprom_readback()\n\nRobert Morris reported:\n\n|If a malicious USB device pretends to be an Intersil p54 wifi\n|interface and generates an eeprom_readback message with a large\n|eeprom->v1.len, p54_rx_eeprom_readback() will copy data from the\n|message beyond the end of priv->eeprom.\n|\n|static void p54_rx_eeprom_readback(struct p54_common *priv,\n|                                   struct sk_buff *skb)\n|{\n|        struct p54_hdr *hdr = (struct p54_hdr *) skb->data;\n|        struct p54_eeprom_lm86 *eeprom = (struct p54_eeprom_lm86 *) hdr->data;\n|\n|        if (priv->fw_var >= 0x509) {\n|                memcpy(priv->eeprom, eeprom->v2.data,\n|                       le16_to_cpu(eeprom->v2.len));\n|        } else {\n|                memcpy(priv->eeprom, eeprom->v1.data,\n|                       le16_to_cpu(eeprom->v1.len));\n|        }\n| [...]\n\nThe eeprom->v{1,2}.len is set by the driver in p54_download_eeprom().\nThe device is supposed to provide the same length back to the driver.\nBut yes, it's possible (like shown in the report) to alter the value\nto something that causes a crash/panic due to overrun.\n\nThis patch addresses the issue by adding the size to the common device\ncontext, so p54_rx_eeprom_readback no longer relies on possibly tampered\nvalues... That said, it also checks if the \"firmware\" altered the value\nand no longer copies them.\n\nThe one, small saving grace is: Before the driver tries to read the eeprom,\nit needs to upload >a< firmware. the vendor firmware has a proprietary\nlicense and as a reason, it is not present on most distributions by\ndefault.",
