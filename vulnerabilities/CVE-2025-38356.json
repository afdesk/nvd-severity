  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/guc: Explicitly exit CT safe mode on unwind\n\nDuring driver probe we might be briefly using CT safe mode, which\nis based on a delayed work, but usually we are able to stop this\nonce we have IRQ fully operational.  However, if we abort the probe\nquite early then during unwind we might try to destroy the workqueue\nwhile there is still a pending delayed work that attempts to restart\nitself which triggers a WARN.\n\nThis was recently observed during unsuccessful VF initialization:\n\n [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1: probe with driver xe failed with error -62\n [ ] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n [ ] workqueue: cannot queue safe_mode_worker_func [xe] on wq xe-g2h-wq\n [ ] WARNING: CPU: 9 PID: 0 at kernel/workqueue.c:2257 __queue_work+0x287/0x710\n [ ] RIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x287/0x710\n [ ] Call Trace:\n [ ]  delayed_work_timer_fn+0x19/0x30\n [ ]  call_timer_fn+0xa1/0x2a0\n\nExit the CT safe mode on unwind to avoid that warning.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 2ddbb73ec20b98e70a5200cb85deade22ccea2ec)",
