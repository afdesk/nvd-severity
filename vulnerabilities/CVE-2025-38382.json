  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix iteration of extrefs during log replay\n\nAt __inode_add_ref() when processing extrefs, if we jump into the next\nlabel we have an undefined value of victim_name.len, since we haven't\ninitialized it before we did the goto. This results in an invalid memory\naccess in the next iteration of the loop since victim_name.len was not\ninitialized to the length of the name of the current extref.\n\nFix this by initializing victim_name.len with the current extref's name\nlength.",
