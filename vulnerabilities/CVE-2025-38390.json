  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: arm_ffa: Fix memory leak by freeing notifier callback node\n\nCommit e0573444edbf (\"firmware: arm_ffa: Add interfaces to request\nnotification callbacks\") adds support for notifier callbacks by allocating\nand inserting a callback node into a hashtable during registration of\nnotifiers. However, during unregistration, the code only removes the\nnode from the hashtable without freeing the associated memory, resulting\nin a memory leak.\n\nResolve the memory leak issue by ensuring the allocated notifier callback\nnode is properly freed after it is removed from the hashtable entry.",
