  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: typec: altmodes/displayport: do not index invalid pin_assignments\n\nA poorly implemented DisplayPort Alt Mode port partner can indicate\nthat its pin assignment capabilities are greater than the maximum\nvalue, DP_PIN_ASSIGN_F. In this case, calls to pin_assignment_show\nwill cause a BRK exception due to an out of bounds array access.\n\nPrevent for loop in pin_assignment_show from accessing\ninvalid values in pin_assignments by adding DP_PIN_ASSIGN_MAX\nvalue in typec_dp.h and using i < DP_PIN_ASSIGN_MAX as a loop\ncondition.",
