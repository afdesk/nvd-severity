  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSv4/pNFS: Fix a race to wake on NFS_LAYOUT_DRAIN\n\nWe found a few different systems hung up in writeback waiting on the same\npage lock, and one task waiting on the NFS_LAYOUT_DRAIN bit in\npnfs_update_layout(), however the pnfs_layout_hdr's plh_outstanding count\nwas zero.\n\nIt seems most likely that this is another race between the waiter and waker\nsimilar to commit ed0172af5d6f (\"SUNRPC: Fix a race to wake a sync task\").\nFix it up by applying the advised barrier.",
