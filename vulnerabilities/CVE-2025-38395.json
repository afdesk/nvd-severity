  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: gpio: Fix the out-of-bounds access to drvdata::gpiods\n\ndrvdata::gpiods is supposed to hold an array of 'gpio_desc' pointers. But\nthe memory is allocated for only one pointer. This will lead to\nout-of-bounds access later in the code if 'config::ngpios' is > 1. So\nfix the code to allocate enough memory to hold 'config::ngpios' of GPIO\ndescriptors.\n\nWhile at it, also move the check for memory allocation failure to be below\nthe allocation to make it more readable.",
