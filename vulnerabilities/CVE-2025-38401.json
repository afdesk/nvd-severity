  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmtk-sd: Prevent memory corruption from DMA map failure\n\nIf msdc_prepare_data() fails to map the DMA region, the request is\nnot prepared for data receiving, but msdc_start_data() proceeds\nthe DMA with previous setting.\nSince this will lead a memory corruption, we have to stop the\nrequest operation soon after the msdc_prepare_data() fails to\nprepare it.",
