  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet: fix memory leak of bio integrity\n\nIf nvmet receives commands with metadata there is a continuous memory\nleak of kmalloc-128 slab or more precisely bio->bi_integrity.\n\nSince commit bf4c89fc8797 (\"block: don't call bio_uninit from bio_endio\")\neach user of bio_init has to use bio_uninit as well. Otherwise the bio\nintegrity is not getting free. Nvmet uses bio_init for inline bios.\n\nUninit the inline bio to complete deallocation of integrity in bio.",
