  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm: Fix a fence leak in submit error path\n\nIn error paths, we could unref the submit without calling\ndrm_sched_entity_push_job(), so msm_job_free() will never get\ncalled.  Since drm_sched_job_cleanup() will NULL out the\ns_fence, we can use that to detect this case.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/653584/",
