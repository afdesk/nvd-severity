  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSquashfs: check return result of sb_min_blocksize\n\nSyzkaller reports an \"UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in squashfs_bio_read\" bug.\n\nSyzkaller forks multiple processes which after mounting the Squashfs\nfilesystem, issues an ioctl(\"/dev/loop0\", LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE, 0x8000). \nNow if this ioctl occurs at the same time another process is in the\nprocess of mounting a Squashfs filesystem on /dev/loop0, the failure\noccurs.  When this happens the following code in squashfs_fill_super()\nfails.\n\n----\nmsblk->devblksize = sb_min_blocksize(sb, SQUASHFS_DEVBLK_SIZE);\nmsblk->devblksize_log2 = ffz(~msblk->devblksize);\n----\n\nsb_min_blocksize() returns 0, which means msblk->devblksize is set to 0.\n\nAs a result, ffz(~msblk->devblksize) returns 64, and msblk->devblksize_log2\nis set to 64.\n\nThis subsequently causes the\n\nUBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/squashfs/block.c:195:36\nshift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka\n'unsigned long long')\n\nThis commit adds a check for a 0 return by sb_min_blocksize().",
