  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf: Fix sample vs do_exit()\n\nBaisheng Gao reported an ARM64 crash, which Mark decoded as being a\nsynchronous external abort -- most likely due to trying to access\nMMIO in bad ways.\n\nThe crash further shows perf trying to do a user stack sample while in\nexit_mmap()'s tlb_finish_mmu() -- i.e. while tearing down the address\nspace it is trying to access.\n\nIt turns out that we stop perf after we tear down the userspace mm; a\nreceipie for disaster, since perf likes to access userspace for\nvarious reasons.\n\nFlip this order by moving up where we stop perf in do_exit().\n\nAdditionally, harden PERF_SAMPLE_CALLCHAIN and PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER\nto abort when the current task does not have an mm (exit_mm() makes\nsure to set current->mm = NULL; before commencing with the actual\nteardown). Such that CPU wide events don't trip on this same problem.",
