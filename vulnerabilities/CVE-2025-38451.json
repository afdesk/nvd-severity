  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/md-bitmap: fix GPF in bitmap_get_stats()\n\nThe commit message of commit 6ec1f0239485 (\"md/md-bitmap: fix stats\ncollection for external bitmaps\") states:\n\n    Remove the external bitmap check as the statistics should be\n    available regardless of bitmap storage location.\n\n    Return -EINVAL only for invalid bitmap with no storage (neither in\n    superblock nor in external file).\n\nBut, the code does not adhere to the above, as it does only check for\na valid super-block for \"internal\" bitmaps. Hence, we observe:\n\nOops: GPF, probably for non-canonical address 0x1cd66f1f40000028\nRIP: 0010:bitmap_get_stats+0x45/0xd0\nCall Trace:\n\n seq_read_iter+0x2b9/0x46a\n seq_read+0x12f/0x180\n proc_reg_read+0x57/0xb0\n vfs_read+0xf6/0x380\n ksys_read+0x6d/0xf0\n do_syscall_64+0x8c/0x1b0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nWe fix this by checking the existence of a super-block for both the\ninternal and external case.",
