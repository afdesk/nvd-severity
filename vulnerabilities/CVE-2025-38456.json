  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipmi:msghandler: Fix potential memory corruption in ipmi_create_user()\n\nThe \"intf\" list iterator is an invalid pointer if the correct\n\"intf->intf_num\" is not found.  Calling atomic_dec(&intf->nr_users) on\nand invalid pointer will lead to memory corruption.\n\nWe don't really need to call atomic_dec() if we haven't called\natomic_add_return() so update the if (intf->in_shutdown) path as well.",
