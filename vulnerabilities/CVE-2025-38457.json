  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Abort __tc_modify_qdisc if parent class does not exist\n\nLion's patch [1] revealed an ancient bug in the qdisc API.\nWhenever a user creates/modifies a qdisc specifying as a parent another\nqdisc, the qdisc API will, during grafting, detect that the user is\nnot trying to attach to a class and reject. However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/d912cbd7-193b-4269-9857-525bee8bbb6a@gmail.com/",
