  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\natm: clip: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in to_atmarpd().\n\natmarpd is protected by RTNL since commit f3a0592b37b8 (\"[ATM]: clip\ncauses unregister hang\").\n\nHowever, it is not enough because to_atmarpd() is called without RTNL,\nespecially clip_neigh_solicit() / neigh_ops->solicit() is unsleepable.\n\nAlso, there is no RTNL dependency around atmarpd.\n\nLet's use a private mutex and RCU to protect access to atmarpd in\nto_atmarpd().",
