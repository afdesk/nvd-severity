  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/exynos: exynos7_drm_decon: add vblank check in IRQ handling\n\nIf there's support for another console device (such as a TTY serial),\nthe kernel occasionally panics during boot. The panic message and a\nrelevant snippet of the call stack is as follows:\n\n  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000000000000\n  Call trace:\n    drm_crtc_handle_vblank+0x10/0x30 (P)\n    decon_irq_handler+0x88/0xb4\n    [...]\n\nOtherwise, the panics don't happen. This indicates that it's some sort\nof race condition.\n\nAdd a check to validate if the drm device can handle vblanks before\ncalling drm_crtc_handle_vblank() to avoid this.",
