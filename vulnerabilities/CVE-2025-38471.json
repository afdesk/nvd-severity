  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: always refresh the queue when reading sock\n\nAfter recent changes in net-next TCP compacts skbs much more\naggressively. This unearthed a bug in TLS where we may try\nto operate on an old skb when checking if all skbs in the\nqueue have matching decrypt state and geometry.\n\n    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in tls_strp_check_rcv+0x898/0x9a0 [tls]\n    (net/tls/tls_strp.c:436 net/tls/tls_strp.c:530 net/tls/tls_strp.c:544)\n    Read of size 4 at addr ffff888013085750 by task tls/13529\n\n    CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 13529 Comm: tls Not tainted 6.16.0-rc5-virtme\n    Call Trace:\n     kasan_report+0xca/0x100\n     tls_strp_check_rcv+0x898/0x9a0 [tls]\n     tls_rx_rec_wait+0x2c9/0x8d0 [tls]\n     tls_sw_recvmsg+0x40f/0x1aa0 [tls]\n     inet_recvmsg+0x1c3/0x1f0\n\nAlways reload the queue, fast path is to have the record in the queue\nwhen we wake, anyway (IOW the path going down \"if !strp->stm.full_len\").",
