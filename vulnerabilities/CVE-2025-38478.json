  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Fix initialization of data for instructions that write to subdevice\n\nSome Comedi subdevice instruction handlers are known to access\ninstruction data elements beyond the first `insn->n` elements in some\ncases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions\nallocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this,\nbut they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codes\nthat write to the subdevice, the first `insn->n` data elements are\ncopied from user-space, but the remaining elements are left\nuninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction\nhandler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first\n`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction\nhandlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are used for\nhandling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES`\nelements are initialized for each instruction that writes to the\nsubdevice.",
