  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large\n\nThe handling of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST` ioctl allocates a kernel buffer to\nhold the array of `struct comedi_insn`, getting the length from the\n`n_insns` member of the `struct comedi_insnlist` supplied by the user.\nThe allocation will fail with a WARNING and a stack dump if it is too\nlarge.\n\nAvoid that by failing with an `-EINVAL` error if the supplied `n_insns`\nvalue is unreasonable.\n\nDefine the limit on the `n_insns` value in the `MAX_INSNS` macro.  Set\nthis to the same value as `MAX_SAMPLES` (65536), which is the maximum\nallowed sum of the values of the member `n` in the array of `struct\ncomedi_insn`, and sensible comedi instructions will have an `n` of at\nleast 1.",
