  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: das16m1: Fix bit shift out of bounds\n\nWhen checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test is used:\n\n\t/* only irqs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15 are valid */\n\tif ((1 << it->options[1]) & 0xdcfc) {\n\nHowever, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace, so\nthe shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by\nrequiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with\nthe original test.",
