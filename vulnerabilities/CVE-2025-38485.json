  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: accel: fxls8962af: Fix use after free in fxls8962af_fifo_flush\n\nfxls8962af_fifo_flush() uses indio_dev->active_scan_mask (with\niio_for_each_active_channel()) without making sure the indio_dev\nstays in buffer mode.\nThere is a race if indio_dev exits buffer mode in the middle of the\ninterrupt that flushes the fifo. Fix this by calling\nsynchronize_irq() to ensure that no interrupt is currently running when\ndisabling buffer mode.\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000 when read\n[...]\n_find_first_bit_le from fxls8962af_fifo_flush+0x17c/0x290\nfxls8962af_fifo_flush from fxls8962af_interrupt+0x80/0x178\nfxls8962af_interrupt from irq_thread_fn+0x1c/0x7c\nirq_thread_fn from irq_thread+0x110/0x1f4\nirq_thread from kthread+0xe0/0xfc\nkthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x2c",
