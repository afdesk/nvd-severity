  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: reject VHT opmode for unsupported channel widths\n\nVHT operating mode notifications are not defined for channel widths\nbelow 20 MHz. In particular, 5 MHz and 10 MHz are not valid under the\nVHT specification and must be rejected.\n\nWithout this check, malformed notifications using these widths may\nreach ieee80211_chan_width_to_rx_bw(), leading to a WARN_ON due to\ninvalid input. This issue was reported by syzbot.\n\nReject these unsupported widths early in sta_link_apply_parameters()\nwhen opmode_notif is used. The accepted set includes 20, 40, 80, 160,\nand 80+80 MHz, which are valid for VHT. While 320 MHz is not defined\nfor VHT, it is allowed to avoid rejecting HE or EHT clients that may\nstill send a VHT opmode notification.",
