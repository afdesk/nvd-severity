  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkasan: remove kasan_find_vm_area() to prevent possible deadlock\n\nfind_vm_area() couldn't be called in atomic_context.  If find_vm_area() is\ncalled to reports vm area information, kasan can trigger deadlock like:\n\nCPU0                                CPU1\nvmalloc();\n alloc_vmap_area();\n  spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock)\n                                    spin_lock_bh(&some_lock);\n   <interrupt occurs>\n   <in softirq>\n   spin_lock(&some_lock);\n                                    <access invalid address>\n                                    kasan_report();\n                                     print_report();\n                                      print_address_description();\n                                       kasan_find_vm_area();\n                                        find_vm_area();\n                                         spin_lock(&vn->busy.lock) // deadlock!\n\nTo prevent possible deadlock while kasan reports, remove kasan_find_vm_area().",
