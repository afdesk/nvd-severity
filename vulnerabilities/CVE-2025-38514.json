  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix oops due to non-existence of prealloc backlog struct\n\nIf an AF_RXRPC service socket is opened and bound, but calls are\npreallocated, then rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() will oops because the\nrxrpc_backlog struct doesn't get allocated until the first preallocation is\nmade.\n\nFix this by returning NULL from rxrpc_alloc_incoming_call() if there is no\nbacklog struct.  This will cause the incoming call to be aborted.",
