  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/sched: Increment job count before swapping tail spsc queue\n\nA small race exists between spsc_queue_push and the run-job worker, in\nwhich spsc_queue_push may return not-first while the run-job worker has\nalready idled due to the job count being zero. If this race occurs, job\nscheduling stops, leading to hangs while waiting on the job\u2019s DMA\nfences.\n\nSeal this race by incrementing the job count before appending to the\nSPSC queue.\n\nThis race was observed on a drm-tip 6.16-rc1 build with the Xe driver in\nan SVM test case.",
