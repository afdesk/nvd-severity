  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: fix use-after-free in cifs_oplock_break\n\nA race condition can occur in cifs_oplock_break() leading to a\nuse-after-free of the cinode structure when unmounting:\n\n  cifs_oplock_break()\n    _cifsFileInfo_put(cfile)\n      cifsFileInfo_put_final()\n        cifs_sb_deactive()\n          [last ref, start releasing sb]\n            kill_sb()\n              kill_anon_super()\n                generic_shutdown_super()\n                  evict_inodes()\n                    dispose_list()\n                      evict()\n                        destroy_inode()\n                          call_rcu(&inode->i_rcu, i_callback)\n    spin_lock(&cinode->open_file_lock)  <- OK\n                            [later] i_callback()\n                              cifs_free_inode()\n                                kmem_cache_free(cinode)\n    spin_unlock(&cinode->open_file_lock)  <- UAF\n    cifs_done_oplock_break(cinode)       <- UAF\n\nThe issue occurs when umount has already released its reference to the\nsuperblock. When _cifsFileInfo_put() calls cifs_sb_deactive(), this\nreleases the last reference, triggering the immediate cleanup of all\ninodes under RCU. However, cifs_oplock_break() continues to access the\ncinode after this point, resulting in use-after-free.\n\nFix this by holding an extra reference to the superblock during the\nentire oplock break operation. This ensures that the superblock and\nits inodes remain valid until the oplock break completes.",
