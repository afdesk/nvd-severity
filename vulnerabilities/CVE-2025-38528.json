  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Reject %p% format string in bprintf-like helpers\n\nstatic const char fmt[] = \"%p%\";\n    bpf_trace_printk(fmt, sizeof(fmt));\n\nThe above BPF program isn't rejected and causes a kernel warning at\nruntime:\n\n    Please remove unsupported %\\x00 in format string\n    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7244 at lib/vsprintf.c:2680 format_decode+0x49c/0x5d0\n\nThis happens because bpf_bprintf_prepare skips over the second %,\ndetected as punctuation, while processing %p. This patch fixes it by\nnot skipping over punctuation. %\\x00 is then processed in the next\niteration and rejected.",
