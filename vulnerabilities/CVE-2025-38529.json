  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: aio_iiro_16: Fix bit shift out of bounds\n\nWhen checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test is used:\n\n\tif ((1 << it->options[1]) & 0xdcfc) {\n\nHowever, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace, so\nthe shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by\nrequiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with\nthe original test.  Valid `it->options[1]` values that select the IRQ\nwill be in the range [1,15]. The value 0 explicitly disables the use of\ninterrupts.",
