  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: common: st_sensors: Fix use of uninitialize device structs\n\nThroughout the various probe functions &indio_dev->dev is used before it\nis initialized. This caused a kernel panic in st_sensors_power_enable()\nwhen the call to devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable() fails and then calls\ndev_err_probe() with the uninitialized device.\n\nThis seems to only cause a panic with dev_err_probe(), dev_err(),\ndev_warn() and dev_info() don't seem to cause a panic, but are fixed\nas well.\n\nThe issue is reported and traced here: [1]",
