  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: tegra: xusb: Fix unbalanced regulator disable in UTMI PHY mode\n\nWhen transitioning from USB_ROLE_DEVICE to USB_ROLE_NONE, the code\nassumed that the regulator should be disabled. However, if the regulator\nis marked as always-on, regulator_is_enabled() continues to return true,\nleading to an incorrect attempt to disable a regulator which is not\nenabled.\n\nThis can result in warnings such as:\n\n[  250.155624] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7326 at drivers/regulator/core.c:3004\n_regulator_disable+0xe4/0x1a0\n[  250.155652] unbalanced disables for VIN_SYS_5V0\n\nTo fix this, we move the regulator control logic into\ntegra186_xusb_padctl_id_override() function since it's directly related\nto the ID override state. The regulator is now only disabled when the role\ntransitions from USB_ROLE_HOST to USB_ROLE_NONE, by checking the VBUS_ID\nregister. This ensures that regulator enable/disable operations are\nproperly balanced and only occur when actually transitioning to/from host\nmode.",
