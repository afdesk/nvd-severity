  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: Fix skb size by accounting for skb_shared_info\n\nWhile transitioning from netdev_alloc_ip_align() to build_skb(), memory\nfor the \"skb_shared_info\" member of an \"skb\" was not allocated. Fix this\nby allocating \"PAGE_SIZE\" as the skb length, accounting for the packet\nlength, headroom and tailroom, thereby including the required memory space\nfor skb_shared_info.",
