  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\natm: clip: Fix memory leak of struct clip_vcc.\n\nioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) allocates struct clip_vcc and set it to\nvcc->user_back.\n\nThe code assumes that vcc_destroy_socket() passes NULL skb\nto vcc->push() when the socket is close()d, and then clip_push()\nfrees clip_vcc.\n\nHowever, ioctl(ATMARPD_CTRL) sets NULL to vcc->push() in\natm_init_atmarp(), resulting in memory leak.\n\nLet's serialise two ioctl() by lock_sock() and check vcc->push()\nin atm_init_atmarp() to prevent memleak.",
