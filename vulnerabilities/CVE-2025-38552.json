  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: plug races between subflow fail and subflow creation\n\nWe have races similar to the one addressed by the previous patch between\nsubflow failing and additional subflow creation. They are just harder to\ntrigger.\n\nThe solution is similar. Use a separate flag to track the condition\n'socket state prevent any additional subflow creation' protected by the\nfallback lock.\n\nThe socket fallback makes such flag true, and also receiving or sending\nan MP_FAIL option.\n\nThe field 'allow_infinite_fallback' is now always touched under the\nrelevant lock, we can drop the ONCE annotation on write.",
