  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree\n\nnetem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem\nresides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a\nsoft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].\nEnsure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other\nnetems.\n\nPrevious approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:\n\n1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered\ntoo specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would\nbe a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future\nDOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].\n\n2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a\nper cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its\nchild, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a\nnetem.\n\n3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb\nto handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement\nin duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal\nnotes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this\nsafeguard.\n\n4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral\npath contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a\npacket to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem\nduplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a\nduplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/8DuRWwfqjoRDLDmBMlIfbrsZg9Gx50DHJc1ilxsEBNe2D6NMoigR_eIRIG0LOjMc3r10nUUZtArXx4oZBIdUfZQrwjcQhdinnMis_0G7VEk=@willsroot.io/\n[2] https://lwn.net/Articles/719297/",
