  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits\n\nTesting by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a\nshift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit\nquantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but\nthere are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size\nset to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because\nof that.\n\nInstead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable\nresult instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bits\nset to 0 -- the same as what snto32() does.",
