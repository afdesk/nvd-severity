  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail\n\nWhen perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the\nevent_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increase\nthe perf_rdpmc_allowed reference counter. But nothing undoes this as\nperf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes another\nreference count leak.\n\nReturn early on failure to prevent that.",
