  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: avoid ref leak in nfsd_open_local_fh()\n\nIf two calls to nfsd_open_local_fh() race and both successfully call\nnfsd_file_acquire_local(), they will both get an extra reference to the\nnet to accompany the file reference stored in *pnf.\n\nOne of them will fail to store (using xchg()) the file reference in\n*pnf and will drop that reference but WON'T drop the accompanying\nreference to the net.  This leak means that when the nfs server is shut\ndown it will hang in nfsd_shutdown_net() waiting for\n&nn->nfsd_net_free_done.\n\nThis patch adds the missing nfsd_net_put().",
