  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: mqprio: fix stack out-of-bounds write in tc entry parsing\n\nTCA_MQPRIO_TC_ENTRY_INDEX is validated using\nNLA_POLICY_MAX(NLA_U32, TC_QOPT_MAX_QUEUE), which allows the value\nTC_QOPT_MAX_QUEUE (16). This leads to a 4-byte out-of-bounds stack\nwrite in the fp[] array, which only has room for 16 elements (0\u201315).\n\nFix this by changing the policy to allow only up to TC_QOPT_MAX_QUEUE - 1.",
