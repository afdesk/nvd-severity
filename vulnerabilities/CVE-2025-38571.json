  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsunrpc: fix client side handling of tls alerts\n\nA security exploit was discovered in NFS over TLS in tls_alert_recv\ndue to its assumption that there is valid data in the msghdr's\niterator's kvec.\n\nInstead, this patch proposes the rework how control messages are\nsetup and used by sock_recvmsg().\n\nIf no control message structure is setup, kTLS layer will read and\nprocess TLS data record types. As soon as it encounters a TLS control\nmessage, it would return an error. At that point, NFS can setup a kvec\nbacked control buffer and read in the control message such as a TLS\nalert. Scott found that a msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer\nas a part of the copy process thus we need to revert the iterator\nbefore calling into the tls_alert_recv.",
