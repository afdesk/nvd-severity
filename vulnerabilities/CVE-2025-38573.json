  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: cs42l43: Property entry should be a null-terminated array\n\nThe software node does not specify a count of property entries, so the\narray must be null-terminated.\n\nWhen unterminated, this can lead to a fault in the downstream cs35l56\namplifier driver, because the node parse walks off the end of the\narray into unknown memory.",
