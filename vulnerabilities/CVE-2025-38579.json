  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usage\n\nKMSAN reported a use of uninitialized value in `__is_extent_mergeable()`\n and `__is_back_mergeable()` via the read extent tree path.\n\nThe root cause is that `get_read_extent_info()` only initializes three\nfields (`fofs`, `blk`, `len`) of `struct extent_info`, leaving the\nremaining fields uninitialized. This leads to undefined behavior\nwhen those fields are accessed later, especially during\nextent merging.\n\nFix it by zero-initializing the `extent_info` struct before population.",
