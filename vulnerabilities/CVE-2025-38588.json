  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()\n\nWhile testing prior patch, I was able to trigger\nan infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size() in the following place:\n\nlist_for_each_entry_rcu(sibling, &f6i->fib6_siblings,\n\t\t\tfib6_siblings) {\n\trt6_nh_nlmsg_size(sibling->fib6_nh, &nexthop_len);\n}\n\nThis is because fib6_del_route() and fib6_add_rt2node()\nuses list_del_rcu(), which can confuse rcu readers,\nbecause they might no longer see the head of the list.\n\nRestart the loop if f6i->fib6_nsiblings is zero.",
