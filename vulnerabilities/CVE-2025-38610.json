  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowercap: dtpm_cpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in get_pd_power_uw()\n\nThe get_pd_power_uw() function can crash with a NULL pointer dereference\nwhen em_cpu_get() returns NULL. This occurs when a CPU becomes impossible\nduring runtime, causing get_cpu_device() to return NULL, which propagates\nthrough em_cpu_get() and leads to a crash when em_span_cpus() dereferences\nthe NULL pointer.\n\nAdd a NULL check after em_cpu_get() and return 0 if unavailable,\nmatching the existing fallback behavior in __dtpm_cpu_setup().\n\n[ rjw: Drop an excess empty code line ]",
