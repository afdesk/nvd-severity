  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvmci: Prevent the dispatching of uninitialized payloads\n\nThe reproducer executes the host's unlocked_ioctl call in two different\ntasks. When init_context fails, the struct vmci_event_ctx is not fully\ninitialized when executing vmci_datagram_dispatch() to send events to all\nvm contexts. This affects the datagram taken from the datagram queue of\nits context by another task, because the datagram payload is not initialized\naccording to the size payload_size, which causes the kernel data to leak\nto the user space.\n\nBefore dispatching the datagram, and before setting the payload content,\nexplicitly set the payload content to 0 to avoid data leakage caused by\nincomplete payload initialization.",
