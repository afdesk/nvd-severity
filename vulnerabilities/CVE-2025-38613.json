  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: gpib: fix unset padding field copy back to userspace\n\nThe introduction of a padding field in the gpib_board_info_ioctl is\nshowing up as initialized data on the stack frame being copyied back\nto userspace in function board_info_ioctl. The simplest fix is to\ninitialize the entire struct to zero to ensure all unassigned padding\nfields are zero'd before being copied back to userspace.",
