  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\neventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion\n\nEnsure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than\nEP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.\n\nCurrently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and\ndoes some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't\nlimit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:\n\n - They don't look upwards in the tree.\n - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of\n   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit\n   28d82dc1c4ed (\"epoll: limit paths\").\n\nEssentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just\nserves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.\n\nA more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph\nedge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no\npaths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5\nedges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.\n\nAs a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,\ntested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may\nhave changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 (\"eventpoll: Fix priority inversion\nproblem\").)\n\nTo fix it:\n\n1. In ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,\nand use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree\nhas already been visited.\n2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum\ndepth of an upwards walk.\n3. In ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length\nbetween epoll nodes to EP_MAX_NESTS edges.",
