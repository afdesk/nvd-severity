  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()\n\nWhen packet_set_ring() releases po->bind_lock, another thread can\nrun packet_notifier() and process an NETDEV_UP event.\n\nThis race and the fix are both similar to that of commit 15fe076edea7\n(\"net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()\").\n\nThere too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while a\npo->bind_lock critical section had to be temporarily released. And\nthe fix was similarly to temporarily set po->num to zero to keep\nthe socket unhooked until the lock is retaken.\n\nThe po->bind_lock in packet_set_ring and packet_notifier precede the\nintroduction of git history.",
