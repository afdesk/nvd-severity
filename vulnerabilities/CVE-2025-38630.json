  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: imxfb: Check fb_add_videomode to prevent null-ptr-deref\n\nfb_add_videomode() can fail with -ENOMEM when its internal kmalloc() cannot\nallocate a struct fb_modelist.  If that happens, the modelist stays empty but\nthe driver continues to register.  Add a check for its return value to prevent\npoteintial null-ptr-deref, which is similar to the commit 17186f1f90d3 (\"fbdev:\nFix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var\").",
