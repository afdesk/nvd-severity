When only a\nsource device is enabled, the coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink function\nis recursively invoked in an attempt to locate an active sink device,\nultimately leading to a stack overflow and system crash. Therefore, disable\nthe replicator1 to break the infinite loop and prevent a potential stack\noverflow.\n\nreplicator1_out   ->   funnel_swao_in6   ->   tmc_etf_swao_in   ->  tmc_etf_swao_out\n     |                                                                     |\nreplicator1_in                                                     replicator_swao_in\n     |                                                                     |\nreplicator0_out1                                                   replicator_swao_out0\n     |                                                                     |\nreplicator0_in                                                     funnel_in1_in3\n     |                                                                     |\ntmc_etf_out <- tmc_etf_in <- funnel_merg_out <- funnel_merg_in1 <- funnel_in1_out\n\n[call trace]\n   dump_backtrace+0x9c/0x128\n   show_stack+0x20/0x38\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x48/0x60\n   dump_stack+0x18/0x28\n   panic+0x340/0x3b0\n   nmi_panic+0x94/0xa0\n   panic_bad_stack+0x114/0x138\n   handle_bad_stack+0x34/0xb8\n   __bad_stack+0x78/0x80\n   coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink+0x28/0xa0 [coresight]\n   coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink+0x5c/0xa0 [coresight]\n   coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink+0x5c/0xa0 [coresight]\n   coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink+0x5c/0xa0 [coresight]\n   coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink+0x5c/0xa0 [coresight]\n   ...\n   coresight_find_activated_sysfs_sink+0x5c/0xa0 [coresight]\n   coresight_enable_sysfs+0x80/0x2a0 [coresight]\n\nside effect after the change:\nOnly trace data originating from AOSS can reach the ETF_SWAO and EUD sinks.",
