  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinctrl: canaan: k230: add NULL check in DT parse\n\nAdd a NULL check for the return value of of_get_property() when\nretrieving the \"pinmux\" property in the group parser. This avoids\na potential NULL pointer dereference if the property is missing\nfrom the device tree node.\n\nAlso fix a typo (\"sintenel\") in the device ID match table comment,\ncorrecting it to \"sentinel\".",
