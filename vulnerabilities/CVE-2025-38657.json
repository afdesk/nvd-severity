  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtw89: mcc: prevent shift wrapping in rtw89_core_mlsr_switch()\n\nThe \"link_id\" value comes from the user via debugfs.  If it's larger\nthan BITS_PER_LONG then that would result in shift wrapping and\npotentially an out of bounds access later.  In fact, we can limit it\nto IEEE80211_MLD_MAX_NUM_LINKS (15).\n\nFortunately, only root can write to debugfs files so the security\nimpact is minimal.",
