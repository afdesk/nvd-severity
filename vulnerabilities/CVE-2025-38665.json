  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: netlink: can_changelink(): fix NULL pointer deref of struct can_priv::do_set_mode\n\nAndrei Lalaev reported a NULL pointer deref when a CAN device is\nrestarted from Bus Off and the driver does not implement the struct\ncan_priv::do_set_mode callback.\n\nThere are 2 code path that call struct can_priv::do_set_mode:\n- directly by a manual restart from the user space, via\n  can_changelink()\n- delayed automatic restart after bus off (deactivated by default)\n\nTo prevent the NULL pointer deference, refuse a manual restart or\nconfigure the automatic restart delay in can_changelink() and report\nthe error via extack to user space.\n\nAs an additional safety measure let can_restart() return an error if\ncan_priv::do_set_mode is not set instead of dereferencing it\nunchecked.",
