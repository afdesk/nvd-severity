  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: core: fix NULL dereference on unbind due to stale coupling data\n\nFailing to reset coupling_desc.n_coupled after freeing coupled_rdevs can\nlead to NULL pointer dereference when regulators are accessed post-unbind.\n\nThis can happen during runtime PM or other regulator operations that rely\non coupling metadata.\n\nFor example, on ridesx4, unbinding the 'reg-dummy' platform device triggers\na panic in regulator_lock_recursive() due to stale coupling state.\n\nEnsure n_coupled is set to 0 to prevent access to invalid pointers.",
