  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()\n\nThe buffer length check before calling uvc_parse_format() only ensured\nthat the buffer has at least 3 bytes (buflen > 2), buf the function\naccesses buffer[3], requiring at least 4 bytes.\n\nThis can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the buffer has exactly 3 bytes.\n\nFix it by checking that the buffer has at least 4 bytes in\nuvc_parse_format().",
