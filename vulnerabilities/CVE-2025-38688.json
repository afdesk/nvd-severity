  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommufd: Prevent ALIGN() overflow\n\nWhen allocating IOVA the candidate range gets aligned to the target\nalignment. If the range is close to ULONG_MAX then the ALIGN() can\nwrap resulting in a corrupted iova.\n\nOpen code the ALIGN() using get_add_overflow() to prevent this.\nThis simplifies the checks as we don't need to check for length earlier\neither.\n\nConsolidate the two copies of this code under a single helper.\n\nThis bug would allow userspace to create a mapping that overlaps with some\nother mapping or a reserved range.",
