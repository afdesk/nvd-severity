  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: add cluster chain loop check for dir\n\nAn infinite loop may occur if the following conditions occur due to\nfile system corruption.\n\n(1) Condition for exfat_count_dir_entries() to loop infinitely.\n    - The cluster chain includes a loop.\n    - There is no UNUSED entry in the cluster chain.\n\n(2) Condition for exfat_create_upcase_table() to loop infinitely.\n    - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.\n    - There are no UNUSED entry and up-case table entry in the cluster\n      chain of the root directory.\n\n(3) Condition for exfat_load_bitmap() to loop infinitely.\n    - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.\n    - There are no UNUSED entry and bitmap entry in the cluster chain\n      of the root directory.\n\n(4) Condition for exfat_find_dir_entry() to loop infinitely.\n    - The cluster chain includes a loop.\n    - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.\n\n(5) Condition for exfat_check_dir_empty() to loop infinitely.\n    - The cluster chain includes a loop.\n    - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.\n    - All files and sub-directories under the directory are deleted.\n\nThis commit adds checks to break the above infinite loop.",
