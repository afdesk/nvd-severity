  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: dvb-frontends: dib7090p: fix null-ptr-deref in dib7090p_rw_on_apb()\n\nIn dib7090p_rw_on_apb, msg is controlled by user. When msg[0].buf is null and\nmsg[0].len is zero, former checks on msg[0].buf would be passed. If accessing\nmsg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer deref would happen. We add\ncheck on msg[0].len to prevent crash. Similar issue occurs when access\nmsg[1].buf[0] and msg[1].buf[1].\n\nSimilar commit: commit 0ed554fd769a (\"media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()\")",
