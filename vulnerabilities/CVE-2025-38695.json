  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Check for hdwq null ptr when cleaning up lpfc_vport structure\n\nIf a call to lpfc_sli4_read_rev() from lpfc_sli4_hba_setup() fails, the\nresultant cleanup routine lpfc_sli4_vport_delete_fcp_xri_aborted() may\noccur before sli4_hba.hdwqs are allocated.  This may result in a null\npointer dereference when attempting to take the abts_io_buf_list_lock for\nthe first hardware queue.  Fix by adding a null ptr check on\nphba->sli4_hba.hdwq and early return because this situation means there\nmust have been an error during port initialization.",
