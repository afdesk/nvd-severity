  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nMIPS: Don't crash in stack_top() for tasks without ABI or vDSO\n\nNot all tasks have an ABI associated or vDSO mapped,\nfor example kthreads never do.\nIf such a task ever ends up calling stack_top(), it will derefence the\nNULL ABI pointer and crash.\n\nThis can for example happen when using kunit:\n\n    mips_stack_top+0x28/0xc0\n    arch_pick_mmap_layout+0x190/0x220\n    kunit_vm_mmap_init+0xf8/0x138\n    __kunit_add_resource+0x40/0xa8\n    kunit_vm_mmap+0x88/0xd8\n    usercopy_test_init+0xb8/0x240\n    kunit_try_run_case+0x5c/0x1a8\n    kunit_generic_run_threadfn_adapter+0x28/0x50\n    kthread+0x118/0x240\n    ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1c\n\nOnly dereference the ABI point if it is set.\n\nThe GIC page is also included as it is specific to the vDSO.\nAlso move the randomization adjustment into the same conditional.",
