  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: bfa: Double-free fix\n\nWhen the bfad_im_probe() function fails during initialization, the memory\npointed to by bfad->im is freed without setting bfad->im to NULL.\n\nSubsequently, during driver uninstallation, when the state machine enters\nthe bfad_sm_stopping state and calls the bfad_im_probe_undo() function,\nit attempts to free the memory pointed to by bfad->im again, thereby\ntriggering a double-free vulnerability.\n\nSet bfad->im to NULL if probing fails.",
