  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: do not BUG when INLINE_DATA_FL lacks system.data xattr\n\nA syzbot fuzzed image triggered a BUG_ON in ext4_update_inline_data()\nwhen an inode had the INLINE_DATA_FL flag set but was missing the\nsystem.data extended attribute.\n\nSince this can happen due to a maiciouly fuzzed file system, we\nshouldn't BUG, but rather, report it as a corrupted file system.\n\nAdd similar replacements of BUG_ON with EXT4_ERROR_INODE() ii\next4_create_inline_data() and ext4_inline_data_truncate().",
