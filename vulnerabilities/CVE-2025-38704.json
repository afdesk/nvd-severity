  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrcu/nocb: Fix possible invalid rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread pointer access\n\nIn the preparation stage of CPU online, if the corresponding\nthe rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread does not exist, will be created,\nthere is a situation where the rdp's rcuop kthreads creation fails,\nand then de-offload this CPU's rdp, does not assign this CPU's\nrdp->nocb_cb_kthread pointer, but this rdp's->nocb_gp_rdp and\nrdp's->rdp_gp->nocb_gp_kthread is still valid.\n\nThis will cause the subsequent re-offload operation of this offline\nCPU, which will pass the conditional check and the kthread_unpark()\nwill access invalid rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread pointer.\n\nThis commit therefore use rdp's->nocb_gp_kthread instead of\nrdp_gp's->nocb_gp_kthread for safety check.",
