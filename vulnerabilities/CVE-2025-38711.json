  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb/server: avoid deadlock when linking with ReplaceIfExists\n\nIf smb2_create_link() is called with ReplaceIfExists set and the name\ndoes exist then a deadlock will happen.\n\nksmbd_vfs_kern_path_locked() will return with success and the parent\ndirectory will be locked.  ksmbd_vfs_remove_file() will then remove the\nfile.  ksmbd_vfs_link() will then be called while the parent is still\nlocked.  It will try to lock the same parent and will deadlock.\n\nThis patch moves the ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_unlock() call to *before*\nksmbd_vfs_link() and then simplifies the code, removing the file_present\nflag variable.",
