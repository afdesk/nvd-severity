  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: don't use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()\n\nWhen the volume header contains erroneous values that do not reflect\nthe actual state of the filesystem, hfsplus_fill_super() assumes that\nthe attributes file is not yet created, which later results in hitting\nBUG_ON() when hfsplus_create_attributes_file() is called. Replace this\nBUG_ON() with -EIO error with a message to suggest running fsck tool.",
