  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: kcm: Fix race condition in kcm_unattach()\n\nsyzbot found a race condition when kcm_unattach(psock)\nand kcm_release(kcm) are executed at the same time.\n\nkcm_unattach() is missing a check of the flag\nkcm->tx_stopped before calling queue_work().\n\nIf the kcm has a reserved psock, kcm_unattach() might get executed\nbetween cancel_work_sync() and unreserve_psock() in kcm_release(),\nrequeuing kcm->tx_work right before kcm gets freed in kcm_done().\n\nRemove kcm->tx_stopped and replace it by the less\nerror-prone disable_work_sync().",
