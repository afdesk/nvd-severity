  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhabanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()\n\nAs soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another\nthread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is\nreturning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland\nrace and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we\nfollow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be\ndestroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed\nby its ->release()), we have a UAF.\n\ndma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().\nhabanalabs export_dmabuf() calls it and then proceeds to access the\nobjects destroyed on close.  In particular, it grabs an extra reference to\nanother struct file that will be dropped as part of ->release() for ours;\nthat \"will be\" is actually \"might have already been\".\n\nFix that by reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install()\nonly when everything had been set up.  As a side benefit, we no longer\nhave the failure exit with file already created, but reference to\nunderlying file (as well as ->dmabuf_export_cnt, etc.) not grabbed yet;\nunlike dma_buf_fd(), fd_install() can't fail.",
