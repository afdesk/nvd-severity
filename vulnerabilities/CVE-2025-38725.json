  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus\n\nWithout setting phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus, current driver may create\nat most 32 mdio phy devices with phy address range from 0x00 ~ 0x1f.\nDLink DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phy\ndevice will bind to net phy driver. This is creating issue during system\nsuspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine() will\ndirectly deference member of phydev->drv for non-main phy devices. Then\nNULL pointer dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy or\ninternal phy is necessary, add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus to workarnoud\nthe issue.",
