  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: asix_devices: Fix PHY address mask in MDIO bus initialization\n\nSyzbot reported shift-out-of-bounds exception on MDIO bus initialization.\n\nThe PHY address should be masked to 5 bits (0-31). Without this\nmask, invalid PHY addresses could be used, potentially causing issues\nwith MDIO bus operations.\n\nFix this by masking the PHY address with 0x1f (31 decimal) to ensure\nit stays within the valid range.",
