  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: qla4xxx: Prevent a potential error pointer dereference\n\nThe qla4xxx_get_ep_fwdb() function is supposed to return NULL on error,\nbut qla4xxx_ep_connect() returns error pointers.  Propagating the error\npointers will lead to an Oops in the caller, so change the error pointers\nto NULL.",
