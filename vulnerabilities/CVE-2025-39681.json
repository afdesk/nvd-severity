  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/cpu/hygon: Add missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in bsp_init helper\n\nSince\n\n  923f3a2b48bd (\"x86/resctrl: Query LLC monitoring properties once during boot\")\n\nresctrl_cpu_detect() has been moved from common CPU initialization code to\nthe vendor-specific BSP init helper, while Hygon didn't put that call in their\ncode.\n\nThis triggers a division by zero fault during early booting stage on our\nmachines with X86_FEATURE_CQM* supported, where get_rdt_mon_resources() tries\nto calculate mon_l3_config with uninitialized boot_cpu_data.x86_cache_occ_scale.\n\nAdd the missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in the Hygon BSP init helper.\n\n  [ bp: Massage commit message. ]",
