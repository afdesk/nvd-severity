  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: pcl726: Prevent invalid irq number\n\nThe reproducer passed in an irq number(0x80008000) that was too large,\nwhich triggered the oob.\n\nAdded an interrupt number check to prevent users from passing in an irq\nnumber that was too large.\n\nIf `it->options[1]` is 31, then `1 << it->options[1]` is still invalid\nbecause it shifts a 1-bit into the sign bit (which is UB in C).\nPossible solutions include reducing the upper bound on the\n`it->options[1]` value to 30 or lower, or using `1U << it->options[1]`.\n\nThe old code would just not attempt to request the IRQ if the\n`options[1]` value were invalid.  And it would still configure the\ndevice without interrupts even if the call to `request_irq` returned an\nerror.  So it would be better to combine this test with the test below.",
