  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdkfd: Destroy KFD debugfs after destroy KFD wq\n\nSince KFD proc content was moved to kernel debugfs, we can't destroy KFD\ndebugfs before kfd_process_destroy_wq. Move kfd_process_destroy_wq prior\nto kfd_debugfs_fini to fix a kernel NULL pointer problem. It happens\nwhen /sys/kernel/debug/kfd was already destroyed in kfd_debugfs_fini but\nkfd_process_destroy_wq calls kfd_debugfs_remove_process. This line\n    debugfs_remove_recursive(entry->proc_dentry);\ntries to remove /sys/kernel/debug/kfd/proc/<pid> while\n/sys/kernel/debug/kfd is already gone. It hangs the kernel by kernel\nNULL pointer.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 0333052d90683d88531558dcfdbf2525cc37c233)",
