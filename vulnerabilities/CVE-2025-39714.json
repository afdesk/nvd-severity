  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: usbtv: Lock resolution while streaming\n\nWhen an program is streaming (ffplay) and another program (qv4l2)\nchanges the TV standard from NTSC to PAL, the kernel crashes due to trying\nto copy to unmapped memory.\n\nChanging from NTSC to PAL increases the resolution in the usbtv struct,\nbut the video plane buffer isn't adjusted, so it overflows.\n\n[hverkuil: call vb2_is_busy instead of vb2_is_streaming]",
