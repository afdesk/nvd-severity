  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock/virtio: Validate length in packet header before skb_put()\n\nWhen receiving a vsock packet in the guest, only the virtqueue buffer\nsize is validated prior to virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put(). Unfortunately,\nvirtio_vsock_skb_rx_put() uses the length from the packet header as the\nlength argument to skb_put(), potentially resulting in SKB overflow if\nthe host has gone wonky.\n\nValidate the length as advertised by the packet header before calling\nvirtio_vsock_skb_rx_put().",
