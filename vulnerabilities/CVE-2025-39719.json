  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: imu: bno055: fix OOB access of hw_xlate array\n\nFix a potential out-of-bounds array access of the hw_xlate array in\nbno055.c.\n\nIn bno055_get_regmask(), hw_xlate was iterated over the length of the\nvals array instead of the length of the hw_xlate array. In the case of\nbno055_gyr_scale, the vals array is larger than the hw_xlate array,\nso this could result in an out-of-bounds access. In practice, this\nshouldn't happen though because a match should always be found which\nbreaks out of the for loop before it iterates beyond the end of the\nhw_xlate array.\n\nBy adding a new hw_xlate_len field to the bno055_sysfs_attr, we can be\nsure we are iterating over the correct length.",
