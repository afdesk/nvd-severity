  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: qat - flush misc workqueue during device shutdown\n\nRepeated loading and unloading of a device specific QAT driver, for\nexample qat_4xxx, in a tight loop can lead to a crash due to a\nuse-after-free scenario. This occurs when a power management (PM)\ninterrupt triggers just before the device-specific driver (e.g.,\nqat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains\nloaded.\n\nSince the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all\ndevices and owned by intel_qat.ko, a deferred routine from the\ndevice-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. If this\nroutine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed\nmemory, resulting in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:\n\n    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffa000002e50a01c\n    #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n    RIP: 0010:pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n    Call Trace:\n      pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n      process_one_work+0x171/0x340\n      worker_thread+0x277/0x3a0\n      kthread+0xf0/0x120\n      ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n\nTo prevent this, flush the misc workqueue during device shutdown to\nensure that all pending work items are completed before the driver is\nunloaded.\n\nNote: This approach may slightly increase shutdown latency if the\nworkqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness\nand stability.",
