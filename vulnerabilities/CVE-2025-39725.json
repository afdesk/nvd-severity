  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/vmscan: fix hwpoisoned large folio handling in shrink_folio_list\n\nIn shrink_folio_list(), the hwpoisoned folio may be large folio, which\ncan't be handled by unmap_poisoned_folio().  For THP, try_to_unmap_one()\nmust be passed with TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD to split huge PMD first and then\nretry.  Without TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger null-ptr deref of\npvmw.pte.  Even we passed TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD, we will trigger a\nWARN_ON_ONCE due to the page isn't in swapcache.\n\nSince UCE is rare in real world, and race with reclaimation is more rare,\njust skipping the hwpoisoned large folio is enough.  memory_failure() will\nhandle it if the UCE is triggered again.\n\nThis happens when memory reclaim for large folio races with\nmemory_failure(), and will lead to kernel panic.  The race is as\nfollows:\n\ncpu0      cpu1\n shrink_folio_list memory_failure\n  TestSetPageHWPoison\n  unmap_poisoned_folio\n  --> trigger BUG_ON due to\n  unmap_poisoned_folio couldn't\n   handle large folio\n\n[tujinjiang@huawei.com: add comment to unmap_poisoned_folio()]",
