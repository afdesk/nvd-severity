  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/migrate: don't overflow max copy size\n\nWith non-page aligned copy, we need to use 4 byte aligned pitch, however\nthe size itself might still be close to our maximum of ~8M, and so the\ndimensions of the copy can easily exceed the S16_MAX limit of the copy\ncommand leading to the following assert:\n\nxe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] Assertion `size / pitch <= ((s16)(((u16)~0U) >> 1))` failed!\nplatform: BATTLEMAGE subplatform: 1\ngraphics: Xe2_HPG 20.01 step A0\nmedia: Xe2_HPM 13.01 step A1\ntile: 0 VRAM 10.0 GiB\nGT: 0 type 1\n\nWARNING: CPU: 23 PID: 10605 at drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_migrate.c:673 emit_copy+0x4b5/0x4e0 [xe]\n\nTo fix this account for the pitch when calculating the number of current\nbytes to copy.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 8c2d61e0e916e077fda7e7b8e67f25ffe0f361fc)",
