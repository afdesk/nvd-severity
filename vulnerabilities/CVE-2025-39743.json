  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: truncate good inode pages when hard link is 0\n\nThe fileset value of the inode copy from the disk by the reproducer is\nAGGR_RESERVED_I. When executing evict, its hard link number is 0, so its\ninode pages are not truncated. This causes the bugon to be triggered when\nexecuting clear_inode() because nrpages is greater than 0.",
