  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrcu: Protect ->defer_qs_iw_pending from data race\n\nOn kernels built with CONFIG_IRQ_WORK=y, when rcu_read_unlock() is\ninvoked within an interrupts-disabled region of code [1], it will invoke\nrcu_read_unlock_special(), which uses an irq-work handler to force the\nsystem to notice when the RCU read-side critical section actually ends.\nThat end won't happen until interrupts are enabled at the soonest.\n\nIn some kernels, such as those booted with rcutree.use_softirq=y, the\nirq-work handler is used unconditionally.\n\nThe per-CPU rcu_data structure's ->defer_qs_iw_pending field is\nupdated by the irq-work handler and is both read and updated by\nrcu_read_unlock_special().  This resulted in the following KCSAN splat:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBUG: KCSAN: data-race in rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler / rcu_read_unlock_special\n\nread to 0xffff96b95f42d8d8 of 1 bytes by task 90 on cpu 8:\n rcu_read_unlock_special+0x175/0x260\n __rcu_read_unlock+0x92/0xa0\n rt_spin_unlock+0x9b/0xc0\n __local_bh_enable+0x10d/0x170\n __local_bh_enable_ip+0xfb/0x150\n rcu_do_batch+0x595/0xc40\n rcu_cpu_kthread+0x4e9/0x830\n smpboot_thread_fn+0x24d/0x3b0\n kthread+0x3bd/0x410\n ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nwrite to 0xffff96b95f42d8d8 of 1 bytes by task 88 on cpu 8:\n rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler+0x1e/0x30\n irq_work_single+0xaf/0x160\n run_irq_workd+0x91/0xc0\n smpboot_thread_fn+0x24d/0x3b0\n kthread+0x3bd/0x410\n ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nno locks held by irq_work/8/88.\nirq event stamp: 200272\nhardirqs last  enabled at (200272): [<ffffffffb0f56121>] finish_task_switch+0x131/0x320\nhardirqs last disabled at (200271): [<ffffffffb25c7859>] __schedule+0x129/0xd70\nsoftirqs last  enabled at (0): [<ffffffffb0ee093f>] copy_process+0x4df/0x1cc0\nsoftirqs last disabled at (0): [<0000000000000000>] 0x0\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that irq-work handlers run with interrupts enabled, which\nmeans that rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() could be interrupted,\nand that interrupt handler might contain an RCU read-side critical\nsection, which might invoke rcu_read_unlock_special().  In the strict\nKCSAN mode of operation used by RCU, this constitutes a data race on\nthe ->defer_qs_iw_pending field.\n\nThis commit therefore disables interrupts across the portion of the\nrcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() that updates the ->defer_qs_iw_pending\nfield.  This suffices because this handler is not a fast path.",
