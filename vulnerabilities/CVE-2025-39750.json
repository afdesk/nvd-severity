  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails\n\nCurrently, if any error occurs during ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_setup(),\nthe tid value is already incremented, even though the corresponding\nTID is not actually allocated. Proceed to\nath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_delete() starting from unallocated tid,\nwhich might leads to freeing unallocated TID and cause potential\ncrash or out-of-bounds access.\n\nHence, fix by correctly decrementing tid before cleanup to match only\nthe successfully allocated TIDs.\n\nAlso, remove tid-- from failure case of ath12k_dp_rx_peer_frag_setup(),\nas decrementing the tid before cleanup in loop will take care of this.\n\nCompile tested only.",
