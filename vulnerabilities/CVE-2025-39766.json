  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Make cake_enqueue return NET_XMIT_CN when past buffer_limit\n\nThe following setup can trigger a WARNING in htb_activate due to\nthe condition: !cl->leaf.q->q.qlen\n\ntc qdisc del dev lo root\ntc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1\ntc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 \\\n       htb rate 64bit\ntc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle f: \\\n       cake memlimit 1b\nping -I lo -f -c1 -s64 -W0.001 127.0.0.1\n\nThis is because the low memlimit leads to a low buffer_limit, which\ncauses packet dropping. However, cake_enqueue still returns\nNET_XMIT_SUCCESS, causing htb_enqueue to call htb_activate with an\nempty child qdisc. We should return NET_XMIT_CN when packets are\ndropped from the same tin and flow.\n\nI do not believe return value of NET_XMIT_CN is necessary for packet\ndrops in the case of ack filtering, as that is meant to optimize\nperformance, not to signal congestion.",
