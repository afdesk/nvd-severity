  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/hisilicon/hibmc: fix the hibmc loaded failed bug\n\nWhen hibmc loaded failed, the driver use hibmc_unload to free the\nresource, but the mutexes in mode.config are not init, which will\naccess an NULL pointer. Just change goto statement to return, because\nhibnc_hw_init() doesn't need to free anything.",
