  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: adc: rzg2l_adc: Set driver data before enabling runtime PM\n\nWhen stress-testing the system by repeatedly unbinding and binding the ADC\ndevice in a loop, and the ADC is a supplier for another device (e.g., a\nthermal hardware block that reads temperature through the ADC), it may\nhappen that the ADC device is runtime-resumed immediately after runtime PM\nis enabled, triggered by its consumer. At this point, since drvdata is not\nyet set and the driver's runtime PM callbacks rely on it, a crash can\noccur. To avoid this, set drvdata just after it was allocated.",
