  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: Fix link speed calculation on retrain failure\n\nWhen pcie_failed_link_retrain() fails to retrain, it tries to revert to the\nprevious link speed.  However it calculates that speed from the Link\nControl 2 register without masking out non-speed bits first.\n\nPCIE_LNKCTL2_TLS2SPEED() converts such incorrect values to\nPCI_SPEED_UNKNOWN (0xff), which in turn causes a WARN splat in\npcie_set_target_speed():\n\n  pci 0000:00:01.1: [1022:14ed] type 01 class 0x060400 PCIe Root Port\n  pci 0000:00:01.1: broken device, retraining non-functional downstream link at 2.5GT/s\n  pci 0000:00:01.1: retraining failed\n  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at drivers/pci/pcie/bwctrl.c:168 pcie_set_target_speed\n  RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: 00000000000000ff RDI: ffff9acd82efa000\n  pcie_failed_link_retrain\n  pci_device_add\n  pci_scan_single_device\n\nMask out the non-speed bits in PCIE_LNKCTL2_TLS2SPEED() and\nPCIE_LNKCAP_SLS2SPEED() so they don't incorrectly return PCI_SPEED_UNKNOWN.\n\n[bhelgaas: commit log, add details from https://lore.kernel.org/r/1c92ef6bcb314ee6977839b46b393282e4f52e74.1750684771.git.lukas@wunner.de]",
