  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: avoid possible overflow for chunk_sectors check in blk_stack_limits()\n\nIn blk_stack_limits(), we check that the t->chunk_sectors value is a\nmultiple of the t->physical_block_size value.\n\nHowever, by finding the chunk_sectors value in bytes, we may overflow\nthe unsigned int which holds chunk_sectors, so change the check to be\nbased on sectors.",
