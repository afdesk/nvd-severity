  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dpu: Add a null ptr check for dpu_encoder_needs_modeset\n\nThe drm_atomic_get_new_connector_state() can return NULL if the\nconnector is not part of the atomic state. Add a check to prevent\na NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThis follows the same pattern used in dpu_encoder_update_topology()\nwithin the same file, which checks for NULL before using conn_state.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/665188/",
