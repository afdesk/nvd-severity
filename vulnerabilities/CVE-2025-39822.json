  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/kbuf: fix signedness in this_len calculation\n\nWhen importing and using buffers, buf->len is considered unsigned.\nHowever, buf->len is converted to signed int when committing. This can\nlead to unexpected behavior if the buffer is large enough to be\ninterpreted as a negative value. Make min_t calculation unsigned.",
