  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcount\n\nCurrent implementation maintains two separate reference counting\nmechanisms: the 'count' field in struct rose_neigh tracks references from\nrose_node structures, while the 'use' field (now refcount_t) tracks\nreferences from rose_sock.\n\nThis patch merges these two reference counting systems using 'use' field\nfor proper reference management. Specifically, this patch adds incrementing\nand decrementing of rose_neigh->use when rose_neigh->count is incremented\nor decremented.\n\nThis patch also modifies rose_rt_free(), rose_rt_device_down() and\nrose_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh objects\nbefore freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().\n\nThese changes ensure rose_neigh structures are properly freed only when\nall references, including those from rose_node structures, are released.\nAs a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot.",
