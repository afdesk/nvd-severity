  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: prevent NULL pointer dereference in UTF16 conversion\n\nThere can be a NULL pointer dereference bug here. NULL is passed to\n__cifs_sfu_make_node without checks, which passes it unchecked to\ncifs_strndup_to_utf16, which in turn passes it to\ncifs_local_to_utf16_bytes where '*from' is dereferenced, causing a crash.\n\nThis patch adds a check for NULL 'src' in cifs_strndup_to_utf16 and\nreturns NULL early to prevent dereferencing NULL pointer.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE",
