  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbatman-adv: fix OOB read/write in network-coding decode\n\nbatadv_nc_skb_decode_packet() trusts coded_len and checks only against\nskb->len. XOR starts at sizeof(struct batadv_unicast_packet), reducing\npayload headroom, and the source skb length is not verified, allowing an\nout-of-bounds read and a small out-of-bounds write.\n\nValidate that coded_len fits within the payload area of both destination\nand source sk_buffs before XORing.",
