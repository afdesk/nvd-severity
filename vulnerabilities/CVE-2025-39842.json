  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: prevent release journal inode after journal shutdown\n\nBefore calling ocfs2_delete_osb(), ocfs2_journal_shutdown() has already\nbeen executed in ocfs2_dismount_volume(), so osb->journal must be NULL. \nTherefore, the following calltrace will inevitably fail when it reaches\njbd2_journal_release_jbd_inode().\n\nocfs2_dismount_volume()->\n  ocfs2_delete_osb()->\n    ocfs2_free_slot_info()->\n      __ocfs2_free_slot_info()->\n        evict()->\n          ocfs2_evict_inode()->\n            ocfs2_clear_inode()->\n\t      jbd2_journal_release_jbd_inode(osb->journal->j_journal,\n\nAdding osb->journal checks will prevent null-ptr-deref during the above\nexecution path.",
