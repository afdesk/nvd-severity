  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nax25: properly unshare skbs in ax25_kiss_rcv()\n\nBernard Pidoux reported a regression apparently caused by commit\nc353e8983e0d (\"net: introduce per netns packet chains\").\n\nskb->dev becomes NULL and we crash in __netif_receive_skb_core().\n\nBefore above commit, different kind of bugs or corruptions could happen\nwithout a major crash.\n\nBut the root cause is that ax25_kiss_rcv() can queue/mangle input skb\nwithout checking if this skb is shared or not.\n\nMany thanks to Bernard Pidoux for his help, diagnosis and tests.\n\nWe had a similar issue years ago fixed with commit 7aaed57c5c28\n(\"phonet: properly unshare skbs in phonet_rcv()\").",
