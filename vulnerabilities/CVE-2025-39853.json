  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni40e: Fix potential invalid access when MAC list is empty\n\nlist_first_entry() never returns NULL - if the list is empty, it still\nreturns a pointer to an invalid object, leading to potential invalid\nmemory access when dereferenced.\n\nFix this by using list_first_entry_or_null instead of list_first_entry.",
