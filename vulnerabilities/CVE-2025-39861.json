  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: vhci: Prevent use-after-free by removing debugfs files early\n\nMove the creation of debugfs files into a dedicated function, and ensure\nthey are explicitly removed during vhci_release(), before associated\ndata structures are freed.\n\nPreviously, debugfs files such as \"force_suspend\", \"force_wakeup\", and\nothers were created under hdev->debugfs but not removed in\nvhci_release(). Since vhci_release() frees the backing vhci_data\nstructure, any access to these files after release would result in\nuse-after-free errors.\n\nAlthough hdev->debugfs is later freed in hci_release_dev(), user can\naccess files after vhci_data is freed but before hdev->debugfs is\nreleased.",
