  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: fix use-after-free when rescheduling brcmf_btcoex_info work\n\nThe brcmf_btcoex_detach() only shuts down the btcoex timer, if the\nflag timer_on is false. However, the brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc(), which\nruns as timer handler, sets timer_on to false. This creates critical\nrace conditions:\n\n1.If brcmf_btcoex_detach() is called while brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc()\nis executing, it may observe timer_on as false and skip the call to\ntimer_shutdown_sync().\n\n2.The brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc() may then reschedule the brcmf_btcoex_info\nworker after the cancel_work_sync() has been executed, resulting in\nuse-after-free bugs.\n\nThe use-after-free bugs occur in two distinct scenarios, depending on\nthe timing of when the brcmf_btcoex_info struct is freed relative to\nthe execution of its worker thread.\n\nScenario 1: Freed before the worker is scheduled\n\nThe brcmf_btcoex_info is deallocated before the worker is scheduled.\nA race condition can occur when schedule_work(&bt_local->work) is\ncalled after the target memory has been freed. The sequence of events\nis detailed below:\n\nCPU0                           | CPU1\nbrcmf_btcoex_detach            | brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc\n                               |   bt_local->timer_on = false;\n  if (cfg->btcoex->timer_on)   |\n    ...                        |\n  cancel_work_sync();          |\n  ...                          |\n  kfree(cfg->btcoex); // FREE  |\n                               |   schedule_work(&bt_local->work); // USE\n\nScenario 2: Freed after the worker is scheduled\n\nThe brcmf_btcoex_info is freed after the worker has been scheduled\nbut before or during its execution. In this case, statements within\nthe brcmf_btcoex_handler() \u2014 such as the container_of macro and\nsubsequent dereferences of the brcmf_btcoex_info object will cause\na use-after-free access. The following timeline illustrates this\nscenario:\n\nCPU0                            | CPU1\nbrcmf_btcoex_detach             | brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc\n                                |   bt_local->timer_on = false;\n  if (cfg->btcoex->timer_on)    |\n    ...                         |\n  cancel_work_sync();           |\n  ...                           |   schedule_work(); // Reschedule\n                                |\n  kfree(cfg->btcoex); // FREE   |   brcmf_btcoex_handler() // Worker\n  /*                            |     btci = container_of(....); // USE\n   The kfree() above could      |     ...\n   also occur at any point      |     btci-> // USE\n   during the worker's execution|\n   */                           |\n\nTo resolve the race conditions, drop the conditional check and call\ntimer_shutdown_sync() directly. It can deactivate the timer reliably,\nregardless of its current state. Once stopped, the timer_on state is\nthen set to false.",
