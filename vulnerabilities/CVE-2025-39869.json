  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: ti: edma: Fix memory allocation size for queue_priority_map\n\nFix a critical memory allocation bug in edma_setup_from_hw() where\nqueue_priority_map was allocated with insufficient memory. The code\ndeclared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8),\nbut allocated memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size.\n\nThis caused out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing:\n  queue_priority_map[i][0] = i;\n  queue_priority_map[i][1] = i;\n\nThe bug manifested as kernel crashes with \"Oops - undefined instruction\"\non ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during EDMA driver probe, as the\nmemory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang.\n\nChange the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) which\nautomatically gets the correct size for the 2D array structure.",
