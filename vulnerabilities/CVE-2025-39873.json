  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: xilinx_can: xcan_write_frame(): fix use-after-free of transmitted SKB\n\ncan_put_echo_skb() takes ownership of the SKB and it may be freed\nduring or after the call.\n\nHowever, xilinx_can xcan_write_frame() keeps using SKB after the call.\n\nFix that by only calling can_put_echo_skb() after the code is done\ntouching the SKB.\n\nThe tx_lock is held for the entire xcan_write_frame() execution and\nalso on the can_get_echo_skb() side so the order of operations does not\nmatter.\n\nAn earlier fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 (\"can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb\nmemory\") did not move the can_put_echo_skb() call far enough.\n\n[mkl: add \"commit\" in front of sha1 in patch description]\n[mkl: fix indention]",
