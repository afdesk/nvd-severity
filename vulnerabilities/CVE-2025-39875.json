  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigb: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test\n\nThe igb driver currently causes a NULL pointer dereference when executing\nthe ethtool loopback test. This occurs because there is no associated\nq_vector for the test ring when it is set up, as interrupts are typically\nnot added to the test rings.\n\nSince commit 5ef44b3cb43b removed the napi_id assignment in\n__xdp_rxq_info_reg(), there is no longer a need to pass a napi_id to it.\nTherefore, simply use 0 as the last parameter.",
