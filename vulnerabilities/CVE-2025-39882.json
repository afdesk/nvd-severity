  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: fix potential OF node use-after-free\n\nThe for_each_child_of_node() helper drops the reference it takes to each\nnode as it iterates over children and an explicit of_node_put() is only\nneeded when exiting the loop early.\n\nDrop the recently introduced bogus additional reference count decrement\nat each iteration that could potentially lead to a use-after-free.",
