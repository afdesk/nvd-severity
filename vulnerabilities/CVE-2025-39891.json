  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mwifiex: Initialize the chan_stats array to zero\n\nThe adapter->chan_stats[] array is initialized in\nmwifiex_init_channel_scan_gap() with vmalloc(), which doesn't zero out\nmemory.  The array is filled in mwifiex_update_chan_statistics()\nand then the user can query the data in mwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey().\n\nThere are two potential issues here.  What if the user calls\nmwifiex_cfg80211_dump_survey() before the data has been filled in.\nAlso the mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() function doesn't necessarily\ninitialize the whole array.  Since the array was not initialized at\nthe start that could result in an information leak.\n\nAlso this array is pretty small.  It's a maximum of 900 bytes so it's\nmore appropriate to use kcalloc() instead vmalloc().",
