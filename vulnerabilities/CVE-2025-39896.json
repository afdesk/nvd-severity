  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naccel/ivpu: Prevent recovery work from being queued during device removal\n\nUse disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() in ivpu_dev_fini()\nto ensure that no new recovery work items can be queued after device\nremoval has started. Previously, recovery work could be scheduled even\nafter canceling existing work, potentially leading to use-after-free\nbugs if recovery accessed freed resources.\n\nRename ivpu_pm_cancel_recovery() to ivpu_pm_disable_recovery() to better\nreflect its new behavior.",
