  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/userfaultfd: fix kmap_local LIFO ordering for CONFIG_HIGHPTE\n\nWith CONFIG_HIGHPTE on 32-bit ARM, move_pages_pte() maps PTE pages using\nkmap_local_page(), which requires unmapping in Last-In-First-Out order.\n\nThe current code maps dst_pte first, then src_pte, but unmaps them in the\nsame order (dst_pte, src_pte), violating the LIFO requirement.  This\ncauses the warning in kunmap_local_indexed():\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 604 at mm/highmem.c:622 kunmap_local_indexed+0x178/0x17c\n  addr \\!= __fix_to_virt(FIX_KMAP_BEGIN + idx)\n\nFix this by reversing the unmap order to respect LIFO ordering.\n\nThis issue follows the same pattern as similar fixes:\n- commit eca6828403b8 (\"crypto: skcipher - fix mismatch between mapping and unmapping order\")\n- commit 8cf57c6df818 (\"nilfs2: eliminate staggered calls to kunmap in nilfs_rename\")\n\nBoth of which addressed the same fundamental requirement that kmap_local\noperations must follow LIFO ordering.",
