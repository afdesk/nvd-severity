  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/vmalloc, mm/kasan: respect gfp mask in kasan_populate_vmalloc()\n\nkasan_populate_vmalloc() and its helpers ignore the caller's gfp_mask and\nalways allocate memory using the hardcoded GFP_KERNEL flag.  This makes\nthem inconsistent with vmalloc(), which was recently extended to support\nGFP_NOFS and GFP_NOIO allocations.\n\nPage table allocations performed during shadow population also ignore the\nexternal gfp_mask.  To preserve the intended semantics of GFP_NOFS and\nGFP_NOIO, wrap the apply_to_page_range() calls into the appropriate\nmemalloc scope.\n\nxfs calls vmalloc with GFP_NOFS, so this bug could lead to deadlock.\n\nThere was a report here\nhttps://lkml.kernel.org/r/686ea951.050a0220.385921.0016.GAE@google.com\n\nThis patch:\n - Extends kasan_populate_vmalloc() and helpers to take gfp_mask;\n - Passes gfp_mask down to alloc_pages_bulk() and __get_free_page();\n - Enforces GFP_NOFS/NOIO semantics with memalloc_*_save()/restore()\n   around apply_to_page_range();\n - Updates vmalloc.c and percpu allocator call sites accordingly.",
