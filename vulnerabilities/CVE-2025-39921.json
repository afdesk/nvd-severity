  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: microchip-core-qspi: stop checking viability of op->max_freq in supports_op callback\n\nIn commit 13529647743d9 (\"spi: microchip-core-qspi: Support per spi-mem\noperation frequency switches\") the logic for checking the viability of\nop->max_freq in mchp_coreqspi_setup_clock() was copied into\nmchp_coreqspi_supports_op(). Unfortunately, op->max_freq is not valid\nwhen this function is called during probe but is instead zero.\nAccordingly, baud_rate_val is calculated to be INT_MAX due to division\nby zero, causing probe of the attached memory device to fail.\n\nSeemingly spi-microchip-core-qspi was the only driver that had such a\nmodification made to its supports_op callback when the per_op_freq\ncapability was added, so just remove it to restore prior functionality.",
