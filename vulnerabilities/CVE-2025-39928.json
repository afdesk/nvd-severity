  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range\n\nAdd an explicit check for the xfer length to 'rtl9300_i2c_config_xfer'\nto ensure the data length isn't within the supported range. In\nparticular a data length of 0 is not supported by the hardware and\ncauses unintended or destructive behaviour.\n\nThis limitation becomes obvious when looking at the register\ndocumentation [1]. 4 bits are reserved for DATA_WIDTH and the value\nof these 4 bits is used as N + 1, allowing a data length range of\n1 <= len <= 16.\n\nAffected by this is the SMBus Quick Operation which works with a data\nlength of 0. Passing 0 as the length causes an underflow of the value\ndue to:\n\n(len - 1) & 0xf\n\nand effectively specifying a transfer length of 16 via the registers.\nThis causes a 16-byte write operation instead of a Quick Write. For\nexample, on SFP modules without write-protected EEPROM this soft-bricks\nthem by overwriting some initial bytes.\n\nFor completeness, also add a quirk for the zero length.\n\n[1] https://svanheule.net/realtek/longan/register/i2c_mst1_ctrl2",
