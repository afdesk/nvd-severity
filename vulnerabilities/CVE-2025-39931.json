  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: af_alg - Set merge to zero early in af_alg_sendmsg\n\nIf an error causes af_alg_sendmsg to abort, ctx->merge may contain\na garbage value from the previous loop.  This may then trigger a\ncrash on the next entry into af_alg_sendmsg when it attempts to do\na merge that can't be done.\n\nFix this by setting ctx->merge to zero near the start of the loop.",
