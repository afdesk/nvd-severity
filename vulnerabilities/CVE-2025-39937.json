  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: rfkill: gpio: Fix crash due to dereferencering uninitialized pointer\n\nSince commit 7d5e9737efda (\"net: rfkill: gpio: get the name and type from\ndevice property\") rfkill_find_type() gets called with the possibly\nuninitialized \"const char *type_name;\" local variable.\n\nOn x86 systems when rfkill-gpio binds to a \"BCM4752\" or \"LNV4752\"\nacpi_device, the rfkill->type is set based on the ACPI acpi_device_id:\n\n        rfkill->type = (unsigned)id->driver_data;\n\nand there is no \"type\" property so device_property_read_string() will fail\nand leave type_name uninitialized, leading to a potential crash.\n\nrfkill_find_type() does accept a NULL pointer, fix the potential crash\nby initializing type_name to NULL.\n\nNote likely sofar this has not been caught because:\n\n1. Not many x86 machines actually have a \"BCM4752\"/\"LNV4752\" acpi_device\n2. The stack happened to contain NULL where type_name is stored",
