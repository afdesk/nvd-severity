  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: sunxi-ng: mp: Fix dual-divider clock rate readback\n\nWhen dual-divider clock support was introduced, the P divider offset was\nleft out of the .recalc_rate readback function. This causes the clock\nrate to become bogus or even zero (possibly due to the P divider being\n1, leading to a divide-by-zero).\n\nFix this by incorporating the P divider offset into the calculation.",
