  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: increase scan_ies_len for S1G\n\nCurrently the S1G capability element is not taken into account\nfor the scan_ies_len, which leads to a buffer length validation\nfailure in ieee80211_prep_hw_scan() and subsequent WARN in\n__ieee80211_start_scan(). This prevents hw scanning from functioning.\nTo fix ensure we accommodate for the S1G capability length.",
