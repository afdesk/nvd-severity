  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: xfrm_alloc_spi shouldn't use 0 as SPI\n\nx->id.spi == 0 means \"no SPI assigned\", but since commit\n94f39804d891 (\"xfrm: Duplicate SPI Handling\"), we now create states\nand add them to the byspi list with this value.\n\n__xfrm_state_delete doesn't remove those states from the byspi list,\nsince they shouldn't be there, and this shows up as a UAF the next\ntime we go through the byspi list.",
