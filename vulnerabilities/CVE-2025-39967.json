  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbcon: fix integer overflow in fbcon_do_set_font\n\nFix integer overflow vulnerabilities in fbcon_do_set_font() where font\nsize calculations could overflow when handling user-controlled font\nparameters.\n\nThe vulnerabilities occur when:\n1. CALC_FONTSZ(h, pitch, charcount) performs h * pith * charcount\n   multiplication with user-controlled values that can overflow.\n2. FONT_EXTRA_WORDS * sizeof(int) + size addition can also overflow\n3. This results in smaller allocations than expected, leading to buffer\n   overflows during font data copying.\n\nAdd explicit overflow checking using check_mul_overflow() and\ncheck_add_overflow() kernel helpers to safety validate all size\ncalculations before allocation.",
