  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfutex: Use correct exit on failure from futex_hash_allocate_default()\n\ncopy_process() uses the wrong error exit path from futex_hash_allocate_default().\nAfter exiting from futex_hash_allocate_default(), neither tasklist_lock\nnor siglock has been acquired. The exit label bad_fork_core_free unlocks\nboth of these locks which is wrong.\n\nThe next exit label, bad_fork_cancel_cgroup, is the correct exit.\nsched_cgroup_fork() did not allocate any resources that need to freed.\n\nUse bad_fork_cancel_cgroup on error exit from futex_hash_allocate_default().",
