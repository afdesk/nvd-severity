  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteontx2-pf: Fix potential use after free in otx2_tc_add_flow()\n\nThis code calls kfree_rcu(new_node, rcu) and then dereferences \"new_node\"\nand then dereferences it on the next line.  Two lines later, we take\na mutex so I don't think this is an RCU safe region.  Re-order it to do\nthe dereferences before queuing up the free.",
