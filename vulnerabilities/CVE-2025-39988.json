  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: etas_es58x: populate ndo_change_mtu() to prevent buffer overflow\n\nSending an PF_PACKET allows to bypass the CAN framework logic and to\ndirectly reach the xmit() function of a CAN driver. The only check\nwhich is performed by the PF_PACKET framework is to make sure that\nskb->len fits the interface's MTU.\n\nUnfortunately, because the etas_es58x driver does not populate its\nnet_device_ops->ndo_change_mtu(), it is possible for an attacker to\nconfigure an invalid MTU by doing, for example:\n\n  $ ip link set can0 mtu 9999\n\nAfter doing so, the attacker could open a PF_PACKET socket using the\nETH_P_CANXL protocol:\n\n\tsocket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_CANXL));\n\nto inject a malicious CAN XL frames. For example:\n\n\tstruct canxl_frame frame = {\n\t\t.flags = 0xff,\n\t\t.len = 2048,\n\t};\n\nThe CAN drivers' xmit() function are calling can_dev_dropped_skb() to\ncheck that the skb is valid, unfortunately under above conditions, the\nmalicious packet is able to go through can_dev_dropped_skb() checks:\n\n  1. the skb->protocol is set to ETH_P_CANXL which is valid (the\n     function does not check the actual device capabilities).\n\n  2. the length is a valid CAN XL length.\n\nAnd so, es58x_start_xmit() receives a CAN XL frame which it is not\nable to correctly handle and will thus misinterpret it as a CAN(FD)\nframe.\n\nThis can result in a buffer overflow. For example, using the es581.4\nvariant, the frame will be dispatched to es581_4_tx_can_msg(), go\nthrough the last check at the beginning of this function:\n\n\tif (can_is_canfd_skb(skb))\n\t\treturn -EMSGSIZE;\n\nand reach this line:\n\n\tmemcpy(tx_can_msg->data, cf->data, cf->len);\n\nHere, cf->len corresponds to the flags field of the CAN XL frame. In\nour previous example, we set canxl_frame->flags to 0xff. Because the\nmaximum expected length is 8, a buffer overflow of 247 bytes occurs!\n\nPopulate net_device_ops->ndo_change_mtu() to ensure that the\ninterface's MTU can not be set to anything bigger than CAN_MTU or\nCANFD_MTU (depending on the device capabilities). By fixing the root\ncause, this prevents the buffer overflow.",
