  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow\n\nA buffer overflow arises from the usage of snprintf to write into the\nbuffer \"buf\" in target_lu_gp_members_show function located in\n/drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c. This buffer is allocated with\nsize LU_GROUP_NAME_BUF (256 bytes).\n\nsnprintf(...) formats multiple strings into buf with the HBA name\n(hba->hba_group.cg_item), a slash character, a devicename (dev->\ndev_group.cg_item) and a newline character, the total formatted string\nlength may exceed the buffer size of 256 bytes.\n\nSince snprintf() returns the total number of bytes that would have been\nwritten (the length of %s/%sn ), this value may exceed the buffer length\n(256 bytes) passed to memcpy(), this will ultimately cause function\nmemcpy reporting a buffer overflow error.\n\nAn additional check of the return value of snprintf() can avoid this\nbuffer overflow.",
