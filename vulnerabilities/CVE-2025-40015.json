  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: stm32-csi: Fix dereference before NULL check\n\nIn 'stm32_csi_start', 'csidev->s_subdev' is dereferenced directly while\nassigning a value to the 'src_pad'. However the same value is being\nchecked against NULL at a later point of time indicating that there\nare chances that the value can be NULL.\n\nMove the dereference after the NULL check.",
