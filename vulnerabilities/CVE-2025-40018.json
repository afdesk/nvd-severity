  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipvs: Defer ip_vs_ftp unregister during netns cleanup\n\nOn the netns cleanup path, __ip_vs_ftp_exit() may unregister ip_vs_ftp\nbefore connections with valid cp->app pointers are flushed, leading to a\nuse-after-free.\n\nFix this by introducing a global `exiting_module` flag, set to true in\nip_vs_ftp_exit() before unregistering the pernet subsystem. In\n__ip_vs_ftp_exit(), skip ip_vs_ftp unregister if called during netns\ncleanup (when exiting_module is false) and defer it to\n__ip_vs_cleanup_batch(), which unregisters all apps after all connections\nare flushed. If called during module exit, unregister ip_vs_ftp\nimmediately.",
