  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost: Take a reference on the task in struct vhost_task.\n\nvhost_task_create() creates a task and keeps a reference to its\ntask_struct. That task may exit early via a signal and its task_struct\nwill be released.\nA pending vhost_task_wake() will then attempt to wake the task and\naccess a task_struct which is no longer there.\n\nAcquire a reference on the task_struct while creating the thread and\nrelease the reference while the struct vhost_task itself is removed.\nIf the task exits early due to a signal, then the vhost_task_wake() will\nstill access a valid task_struct. The wake is safe and will be skipped\nin this case.",
