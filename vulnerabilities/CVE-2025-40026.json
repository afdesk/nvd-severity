  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Don't (re)check L1 intercepts when completing userspace I/O\n\nWhen completing emulation of instruction that generated a userspace exit\nfor I/O, don't recheck L1 intercepts as KVM has already finished that\nphase of instruction execution, i.e. has already committed to allowing L2\nto perform I/O.  If L1 (or host userspace) modifies the I/O permission\nbitmaps during the exit to userspace,  KVM will treat the access as being\nintercepted despite already having emulated the I/O access.\n\nPivot on EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE to detect that KVM is completing emulation.\nOf the three users of EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE, only complete_emulated_io() (the\nintended \"recipient\") can reach the code in question.  gp_interception()'s\nuse is mutually exclusive with is_guest_mode(), and\ncomplete_emulated_insn_gp() unconditionally pairs EMULTYPE_NO_DECODE with\nEMULTYPE_SKIP.\n\nThe bad behavior was detected by a syzkaller program that toggles port I/O\ninterception during the userspace I/O exit, ultimately resulting in a WARN\non vcpu->arch.pio.count being non-zero due to KVM no completing emulation\nof the I/O instruction.\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 23 PID: 1083 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:8039 emulator_pio_in_out+0x154/0x170 [kvm]\n  Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm irqbypass\n  CPU: 23 UID: 1000 PID: 1083 Comm: repro Not tainted 6.16.0-rc5-c1610d2d66b1-next-vm #74 NONE\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015\n  RIP: 0010:emulator_pio_in_out+0x154/0x170 [kvm]\n  PKRU: 55555554\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   kvm_fast_pio+0xd6/0x1d0 [kvm]\n   vmx_handle_exit+0x149/0x610 [kvm_intel]\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0xda8/0x1ac0 [kvm]\n   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x244/0x8c0 [kvm]\n   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x8a/0xd0\n   do_syscall_64+0x5d/0xc60\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n   </TASK>",
