  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinder: fix double-free in dbitmap\n\nA process might fail to allocate a new bitmap when trying to expand its\nproc->dmap. In that case, dbitmap_grow() fails and frees the old bitmap\nvia dbitmap_free(). However, the driver calls dbitmap_free() again when\nthe same process terminates, leading to a double-free error:\n\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KASAN: double-free in binder_proc_dec_tmpref+0x2e0/0x55c\n  Free of addr ffff00000b7c1420 by task kworker/9:1/209\n\n  CPU: 9 UID: 0 PID: 209 Comm: kworker/9:1 Not tainted 6.17.0-rc6-dirty #5 PREEMPT\n  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n  Workqueue: events binder_deferred_func\n  Call trace:\n   kfree+0x164/0x31c\n   binder_proc_dec_tmpref+0x2e0/0x55c\n   binder_deferred_func+0xc24/0x1120\n   process_one_work+0x520/0xba4\n  [...]\n\n  Allocated by task 448:\n   __kmalloc_noprof+0x178/0x3c0\n   bitmap_zalloc+0x24/0x30\n   binder_open+0x14c/0xc10\n  [...]\n\n  Freed by task 449:\n   kfree+0x184/0x31c\n   binder_inc_ref_for_node+0xb44/0xe44\n   binder_transaction+0x29b4/0x7fbc\n   binder_thread_write+0x1708/0x442c\n   binder_ioctl+0x1b50/0x2900\n  [...]\n  ==================================================================\n\nFix this issue by marking proc->map NULL in dbitmap_free().",
