  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: fix possible map leak in fastrpc_put_args\n\ncopy_to_user() failure would cause an early return without cleaning up\nthe fdlist, which has been updated by the DSP. This could lead to map\nleak. Fix this by redirecting to a cleanup path on failure, ensuring\nthat all mapped buffers are properly released before returning.",
