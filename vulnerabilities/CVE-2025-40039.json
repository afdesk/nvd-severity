  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list access\n\nThe 'sess->rpc_handle_list' XArray manages RPC handles within a ksmbd\nsession. Access to this list is intended to be protected by\n'sess->rpc_lock' (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was\nflawed, leading to potential race conditions.\n\nIn ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock\nbefore calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify\nthe XArray structure, a write lock is required to ensure exclusive access\nand prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.\n\nFurthermore, ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load()\nwithout holding any lock at all. This could lead to reading inconsistent\ndata or a potential use-after-free if an entry is concurrently removed and\nthe pointer is dereferenced.\n\nFix these issues by:\n1. Using down_write() and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()\n   to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification, and ensuring\n   the lock is correctly released on error paths.\n2. Adding down_read() and up_read() in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()\n   to safely protect the lookup.",
