  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: nfc: nci: Add parameter validation for packet data\n\nSyzbot reported an uninitialized value bug in nci_init_req, which was\nintroduced by commit 5aca7966d2a7 (\"Merge tag\n'perf-tools-fixes-for-v6.17-2025-09-16' of\ngit://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools\").\n\nThis bug arises due to very limited and poor input validation\nthat was done at nic_valid_size(). This validation only\nvalidates the skb->len (directly reflects size provided at the\nuserspace interface) with the length provided in the buffer\nitself (interpreted as NCI_HEADER). This leads to the processing\nof memory content at the address assuming the correct layout\nper what opcode requires there. This leads to the accesses to\nbuffer of `skb_buff->data` which is not assigned anything yet.\n\nFollowing the same silent drop of packets of invalid sizes at\n`nic_valid_size()`, add validation of the data in the respective\nhandlers and return error values in case of failure. Release\nthe skb if error values are returned from handlers in\n`nci_nft_packet` and effectively do a silent drop\n\nPossible TODO: because we silently drop the packets, the\ncall to `nci_request` will be waiting for completion of request\nand will face timeouts. These timeouts can get excessively logged\nin the dmesg. A proper handling of them may require to export\n`nci_request_cancel` (or propagate error handling from the\nnft packets handlers).",
