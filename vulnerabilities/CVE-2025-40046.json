  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/zcrx: fix overshooting recv limit\n\nIt's reported that sometimes a zcrx request can receive more than was\nrequested. It's caused by io_zcrx_recv_skb() adjusting desc->count for\nall received buffers including frag lists, but then doing recursive\ncalls to process frag list skbs, which leads to desc->count double\naccounting and underflow.",
