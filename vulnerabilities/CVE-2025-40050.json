  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Skip scalar adjustment for BPF_NEG if dst is a pointer\n\nIn check_alu_op(), the verifier currently calls check_reg_arg() and\nadjust_scalar_min_max_vals() unconditionally for BPF_NEG operations.\nHowever, if the destination register holds a pointer, these scalar\nadjustments are unnecessary and potentially incorrect.\n\nThis patch adds a check to skip the adjustment logic when the destination\nregister contains a pointer.",
