  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dlink: handle copy_thresh allocation failure\n\nThe driver did not handle failure of `netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align()`.\nIf the allocation failed, dereferencing `skb->protocol` could lead to\na NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThis patch tries to allocate `skb`. If the allocation fails, it falls\nback to the normal path.\n\nTested-on: D-Link DGE-550T Rev-A3",
