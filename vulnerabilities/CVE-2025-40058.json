  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Disallow dirty tracking if incoherent page walk\n\nDirty page tracking relies on the IOMMU atomically updating the dirty bit\nin the paging-structure entry. For this operation to succeed, the paging-\nstructure memory must be coherent between the IOMMU and the CPU. In\nanother word, if the iommu page walk is incoherent, dirty page tracking\ndoesn't work.\n\nThe Intel VT-d specification, Section 3.10 \"Snoop Behavior\" states:\n\n\"Remapping hardware encountering the need to atomically update A/EA/D bits\n in a paging-structure entry that is not snooped will result in a non-\n recoverable fault.\"\n\nTo prevent an IOMMU from being incorrectly configured for dirty page\ntracking when it is operating in an incoherent mode, mark SSADS as\nsupported only when both ecap_slads and ecap_smpwc are supported.",
