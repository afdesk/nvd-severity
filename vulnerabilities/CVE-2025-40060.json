  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncoresight: trbe: Return NULL pointer for allocation failures\n\nWhen the TRBE driver fails to allocate a buffer, it currently returns\nthe error code \"-ENOMEM\". However, the caller etm_setup_aux() only\nchecks for a NULL pointer, so it misses the error. As a result, the\ndriver continues and eventually causes a kernel panic.\n\nFix this by returning a NULL pointer from arm_trbe_alloc_buffer() on\nallocation failures. This allows that the callers can properly handle\nthe failure.",
