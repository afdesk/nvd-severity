  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: hisilicon/qm - set NULL to qm->debug.qm_diff_regs\n\nWhen the initialization of qm->debug.acc_diff_reg fails,\nthe probe process does not exit. However, after qm->debug.qm_diff_regs is\nfreed, it is not set to NULL. This can lead to a double free when the\nremove process attempts to free it again. Therefore, qm->debug.qm_diff_regs\nshould be set to NULL after it is freed.",
