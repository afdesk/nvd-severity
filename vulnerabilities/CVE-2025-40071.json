  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: n_gsm: Don't block input queue by waiting MSC\n\nCurrently gsm_queue() processes incoming frames and when opening\na DLC channel it calls gsm_dlci_open() which calls gsm_modem_update().\nIf basic mode is used it calls gsm_modem_upd_via_msc() and it\ncannot block the input queue by waiting the response to come\ninto the same input queue.\n\nInstead allow sending Modem Status Command without waiting for remote\nend to respond. Define a new function gsm_modem_send_initial_msc()\nfor this purpose. As MSC is only valid for basic encoding, it does\nnot do anything for advanced or when convergence layer type 2 is used.",
