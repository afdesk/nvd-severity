  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: rcar-host: Pass proper IRQ domain to generic_handle_domain_irq()\n\nStarting with commit dd26c1a23fd5 (\"PCI: rcar-host: Switch to\nmsi_create_parent_irq_domain()\"), the MSI parent IRQ domain is NULL because\nthe object of type struct irq_domain_info passed to:\n\nmsi_create_parent_irq_domain() ->\n  irq_domain_instantiate()() ->\n    __irq_domain_instantiate()\n\nhas no reference to the parent IRQ domain. Using msi->domain->parent as an\nargument for generic_handle_domain_irq() leads to below error:\n\n\t\"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address\"\n\nThis error was identified while switching the upcoming RZ/G3S PCIe host\ncontroller driver to msi_create_parent_irq_domain() (which was using a\nsimilar pattern to handle MSIs (see link section)), but it was not tested\non hardware using the pcie-rcar-host controller driver due to lack of\nhardware.\n\n[mani: reworded subject and description]",
