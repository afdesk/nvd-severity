  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer deference in try_to_register_card\n\nIn try_to_register_card(), the return value of usb_ifnum_to_if() is\npassed directly to usb_interface_claimed() without a NULL check, which\nwill lead to a NULL pointer dereference when creating an invalid\nUSB audio device. Fix this by adding a check to ensure the interface\npointer is valid before passing it to usb_interface_claimed().",
