  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()\n\nThe comedi_buf_munge() function performs a modulo operation\n`async->munge_chan %= async->cmd.chanlist_len` without first\nchecking if chanlist_len is zero. If a user program submits a command with\nchanlist_len set to zero, this causes a divide-by-zero error when the device\nprocesses data in the interrupt handler path.\n\nAdd a check for zero chanlist_len at the beginning of the\nfunction, similar to the existing checks for !map and\nCMDF_RAWDATA flag. When chanlist_len is zero, update\nmunge_count and return early, indicating the data was\nhandled without munging.\n\nThis prevents potential kernel panics from malformed user commands.",
