  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vmwgfx: Fix a null-ptr access in the cursor snooper\n\nCheck that the resource which is converted to a surface exists before\ntrying to use the cursor snooper on it.\n\nvmw_cmd_res_check allows explicit invalid (SVGA3D_INVALID_ID) identifiers\nbecause some svga commands accept SVGA3D_INVALID_ID to mean \"no surface\",\nunfortunately functions that accept the actual surfaces as objects might\n(and in case of the cursor snooper, do not) be able to handle null\nobjects. Make sure that we validate not only the identifier (via the\nvmw_cmd_res_check) but also check that the actual resource exists before\ntrying to do something with it.\n\nFixes unchecked null-ptr reference in the snooping code.",
