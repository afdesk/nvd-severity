  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: asix: hold PM usage ref to avoid PM/MDIO + RTNL deadlock\n\nPrevent USB runtime PM (autosuspend) for AX88772* in bind.\n\nusbnet enables runtime PM (autosuspend) by default, so disabling it via\nthe usb_driver flag is ineffective. On AX88772B, autosuspend shows no\nmeasurable power saving with current driver (no link partner, admin\nup/down). The ~0.453 W -> ~0.248 W drop on v6.1 comes from phylib powering\nthe PHY off on admin-down, not from USB autosuspend.\n\nThe real hazard is that with runtime PM enabled, ndo_open() (under RTNL)\nmay synchronously trigger autoresume (usb_autopm_get_interface()) into\nasix_resume() while the USB PM lock is held. Resume paths then invoke\nphylink/phylib and MDIO, which also expect RTNL, leading to possible\ndeadlocks or PM lock vs MDIO wake issues.\n\nTo avoid this, keep the device runtime-PM active by taking a usage\nreference in ax88772_bind() and dropping it in unbind(). A non-zero PM\nusage count blocks runtime suspend regardless of userspace policy\n(.../power/control - pm_runtime_allow/forbid), making this approach\nrobust against sysfs overrides.\n\nHolding a runtime-PM usage ref does not affect system-wide suspend;\nsystem sleep/resume callbacks continue to run as before.",
