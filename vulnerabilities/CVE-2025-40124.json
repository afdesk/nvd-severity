  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III\n\nAnthony Yznaga tracked down that a BUG_ON in ext4 code with large folios\nenabled resulted from copy_from_user() returning impossibly large values\ngreater than the size to be copied. This lead to __copy_from_iter()\nreturning impossible values instead of the actual number of bytes it was\nable to copy.\n\nThe BUG_ON has been reported in\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/r/b14f55642207e63e907965e209f6323a0df6dcee.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de\n\nThe referenced commit introduced exception handlers on user-space memory\nreferences in copy_from_user and copy_to_user. These handlers return from\nthe respective function and calculate the remaining bytes left to copy\nusing the current register contents. The exception handlers expect that\n%o2 has already been masked during the bulk copy loop, but the masking was\nperformed after that loop. This will fix the return value of copy_from_user\nand copy_to_user in the faulting case. The behaviour of memcpy stays\nunchanged.",
