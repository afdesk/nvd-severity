  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in in smc_clc_prfx_set().\n\nsmc_clc_prfx_set() is called during connect() and not under RCU\nnor RTNL.\n\nUsing sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.\n\nLet's use __sk_dst_get() and dev_dst_rcu() under rcu_read_lock()\nafter kernel_getsockname().\n\nNote that the returned value of smc_clc_prfx_set() is not used\nin the caller.\n\nWhile at it, we change the 1st arg of smc_clc_prfx_set[46]_rcu()\nnot to touch dst there.",
