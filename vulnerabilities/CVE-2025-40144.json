  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvdimm: ndtest: Return -ENOMEM if devm_kcalloc() fails in ndtest_probe()\n\ndevm_kcalloc() may fail. ndtest_probe() allocates three DMA address\narrays (dcr_dma, label_dma, dimm_dma) and later unconditionally uses\nthem in ndtest_nvdimm_init(), which can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference under low-memory conditions.\n\nCheck all three allocations and return -ENOMEM if any allocation fails,\njumping to the common error path. Do not emit an extra error message\nsince the allocator already warns on allocation failure.",
