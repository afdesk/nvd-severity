  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/pwrctrl: Fix double cleanup on devm_add_action_or_reset() failure\n\nWhen devm_add_action_or_reset() fails, it calls the passed cleanup\nfunction.  Hence the caller must not repeat that cleanup.\n\nReplace the \"goto err_regulator_free\" by the actual freeing, as there\nwill never be a need again for a second user of this label.",
