  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: fix to avoid migrating empty section\n\nIt reports a bug from device w/ zufs:\n\nF2FS-fs (dm-64): Inconsistent segment (173822) type [1, 0] in SSA and SIT\nF2FS-fs (dm-64): Stopped filesystem due to reason: 4\n\nThread A\t\t\t\tThread B\n- f2fs_expand_inode_data\n - f2fs_allocate_pinning_section\n  - f2fs_gc_range\n   - do_garbage_collect w/ segno #x\n\t\t\t\t\t- writepage\n\t\t\t\t\t - f2fs_allocate_data_block\n\t\t\t\t\t  - new_curseg\n\t\t\t\t\t   - allocate segno #x\n\nThe root cause is: fallocate on pinning file may race w/ block allocation\nas above, result in do_garbage_collect() from fallocate() may migrate\nsegment which is just allocated by a log, the log will update segment type\nin its in-memory structure, however GC will get segment type from on-disk\nSSA block, once segment type changes by log, we can detect such\ninconsistency, then shutdown filesystem.\n\nIn this case, on-disk SSA shows type of segno #173822 is 1 (SUM_TYPE_NODE),\nhowever segno #173822 was just allocated as data type segment, so in-memory\nSIT shows type of segno #173822 is 0 (SUM_TYPE_DATA).\n\nChange as below to fix this issue:\n- check whether current section is empty before gc\n- add sanity checks on do_garbage_collect() to avoid any race case, result\nin migrating segment used by log.\n- btw, it fixes misc issue in printed logs: \"SSA and SIT\" -> \"SIT and SSA\".",
