  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nEDAC/i10nm: Skip DIMM enumeration on a disabled memory controller\n\nWhen loading the i10nm_edac driver on some Intel Granite Rapids servers,\na call trace may appear as follows:\n\n  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/edac/skx_common.c:453:16\n  shift exponent -66 is negative\n  ...\n  __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x1e3/0x390\n  skx_get_dimm_info.cold+0x47/0xd40 [skx_edac_common]\n  i10nm_get_dimm_config+0x23e/0x390 [i10nm_edac]\n  skx_register_mci+0x159/0x220 [skx_edac_common]\n  i10nm_init+0xcb0/0x1ff0 [i10nm_edac]\n  ...\n\nThis occurs because some BIOS may disable a memory controller if there\naren't any memory DIMMs populated on this memory controller. The DIMMMTR\nregister of this disabled memory controller contains the invalid value\n~0, resulting in the call trace above.\n\nFix this call trace by skipping DIMM enumeration on a disabled memory\ncontroller.",
