  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxsk: Harden userspace-supplied xdp_desc validation\n\nTurned out certain clearly invalid values passed in xdp_desc from\nuserspace can pass xp_{,un}aligned_validate_desc() and then lead\nto UBs or just invalid frames to be queued for xmit.\n\ndesc->len close to ``U32_MAX`` with a non-zero pool->tx_metadata_len\ncan cause positive integer overflow and wraparound, the same way low\nenough desc->addr with a non-zero pool->tx_metadata_len can cause\nnegative integer overflow. Both scenarios can then pass the\nvalidation successfully.\nThis doesn't happen with valid XSk applications, but can be used\nto perform attacks.\n\nAlways promote desc->len to ``u64`` first to exclude positive\noverflows of it. Use explicit check_{add,sub}_overflow() when\nvalidating desc->addr (which is ``u64`` already).\n\nbloat-o-meter reports a little growth of the code size:\n\nadd/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 2/1 up/down: 60/-16 (44)\nFunction                                     old     new   delta\nxskq_cons_peek_desc                          299     330     +31\nxsk_tx_peek_release_desc_batch               973    1002     +29\nxsk_generic_xmit                            3148    3132     -16\n\nbut hopefully this doesn't hurt the performance much.",
