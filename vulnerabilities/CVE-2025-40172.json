  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naccel/qaic: Treat remaining == 0 as error in find_and_map_user_pages()\n\nCurrently, if find_and_map_user_pages() takes a DMA xfer request from the\nuser with a length field set to 0, or in a rare case, the host receives\nQAIC_TRANS_DMA_XFER_CONT from the device where resources->xferred_dma_size\nis equal to the requested transaction size, the function will return 0\nbefore allocating an sgt or setting the fields of the dma_xfer struct.\nIn that case, encode_addr_size_pairs() will try to access the sgt which\nwill lead to a general protection fault.\n\nReturn an EINVAL in case the user provides a zero-sized ALP, or the device\nrequests continuation after all of the bytes have been transferred.",
