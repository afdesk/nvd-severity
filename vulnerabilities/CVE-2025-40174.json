  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm: Fix SMP ordering in switch_mm_irqs_off()\n\nStephen noted that it is possible to not have an smp_mb() between\nthe loaded_mm store and the tlb_gen load in switch_mm(), meaning the\nordering against flush_tlb_mm_range() goes out the window, and it\nbecomes possible for switch_mm() to not observe a recent tlb_gen\nupdate and fail to flush the TLBs.\n\n[ dhansen: merge conflict fixed by Ingo ]",
