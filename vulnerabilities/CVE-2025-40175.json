  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nidpf: cleanup remaining SKBs in PTP flows\n\nWhen the driver requests Tx timestamp value, one of the first steps is\nto clone SKB using skb_get. It increases the reference counter for that\nSKB to prevent unexpected freeing by another component.\nHowever, there may be a case where the index is requested, SKB is\nassigned and never consumed by PTP flows - for example due to reset during\nrunning PTP apps.\n\nAdd a check in release timestamping function to verify if the SKB\nassigned to Tx timestamp latch was freed, and release remaining SKBs.",
