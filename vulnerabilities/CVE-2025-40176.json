  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: wait for pending async decryptions if tls_strp_msg_hold fails\n\nAsync decryption calls tls_strp_msg_hold to create a clone of the\ninput skb to hold references to the memory it uses. If we fail to\nallocate that clone, proceeding with async decryption can lead to\nvarious issues (UAF on the skb, writing into userspace memory after\nthe recv() call has returned).\n\nIn this case, wait for all pending decryption requests.",
