  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: guard against EA inode refcount underflow in xattr update\n\nsyzkaller found a path where ext4_xattr_inode_update_ref() reads an EA\ninode refcount that is already <= 0 and then applies ref_change (often\n-1). That lets the refcount underflow and we proceed with a bogus value,\ntriggering errors like:\n\n  EXT4-fs error: EA inode <n> ref underflow: ref_count=-1 ref_change=-1\n  EXT4-fs warning: ea_inode dec ref err=-117\n\nMake the invariant explicit: if the current refcount is non-positive,\ntreat this as on-disk corruption, emit ext4_error_inode(), and fail the\noperation with -EFSCORRUPTED instead of updating the refcount. Delete the\nWARN_ONCE() as negative refcounts are now impossible; keep error reporting\nin ext4_error_inode().\n\nThis prevents the underflow and the follow-on orphan/cleanup churn.",
