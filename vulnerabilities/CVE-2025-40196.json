  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: quota: create dedicated workqueue for quota_release_work\n\nThere is a kernel panic due to WARN_ONCE when panic_on_warn is set.\n\nThis issue occurs when writeback is triggered due to sync call for an\nopened file(ie, writeback reason is WB_REASON_SYNC). When f2fs balance\nis needed at sync path, flush for quota_release_work is triggered.\nBy default quota_release_work is queued to \"events_unbound\" queue which\ndoes not have WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag. During f2fs balance \"writeback\"\nworkqueue tries to flush quota_release_work causing kernel panic due to\nMEM_RECLAIM flag mismatch errors.\n\nThis patch creates dedicated workqueue with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag\nfor work quota_release_work.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nWARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 14867 at kernel/workqueue.c:3721 check_flush_dependency+0x13c/0x148\nCall trace:\n check_flush_dependency+0x13c/0x148\n __flush_work+0xd0/0x398\n flush_delayed_work+0x44/0x5c\n dquot_writeback_dquots+0x54/0x318\n f2fs_do_quota_sync+0xb8/0x1a8\n f2fs_write_checkpoint+0x3cc/0x99c\n f2fs_gc+0x190/0x750\n f2fs_balance_fs+0x110/0x168\n f2fs_write_single_data_page+0x474/0x7dc\n f2fs_write_data_pages+0x7d0/0xd0c\n do_writepages+0xe0/0x2f4\n __writeback_single_inode+0x44/0x4ac\n writeback_sb_inodes+0x30c/0x538\n wb_writeback+0xf4/0x440\n wb_workfn+0x128/0x5d4\n process_scheduled_works+0x1c4/0x45c\n worker_thread+0x32c/0x3e8\n kthread+0x11c/0x1b0\n ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\nKernel panic - not syncing: kernel: panic_on_warn set ...",
