  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npage_pool: Fix PP_MAGIC_MASK to avoid crashing on some 32-bit arches\n\nHelge reported that the introduction of PP_MAGIC_MASK let to crashes on\nboot on his 32-bit parisc machine. The cause of this is the mask is set\ntoo wide, so the page_pool_page_is_pp() incurs false positives which\ncrashes the machine.\n\nJust disabling the check in page_pool_is_pp() will lead to the page_pool\ncode itself malfunctioning; so instead of doing this, this patch changes\nthe define for PP_DMA_INDEX_BITS to avoid mistaking arbitrary kernel\npointers for page_pool-tagged pages.\n\nThe fix relies on the kernel pointers that alias with the pp_magic field\nalways being above PAGE_OFFSET. With this assumption, we can use the\nlowest bit of the value of PAGE_OFFSET as the upper bound of the\nPP_DMA_INDEX_MASK, which should avoid the false positives.\n\nBecause we cannot rely on PAGE_OFFSET always being a compile-time\nconstant, nor on it always being >0, we fall back to disabling the\ndma_index storage when there are not enough bits available. This leaves\nus in the situation we were in before the patch in the Fixes tag, but\nonly on a subset of architecture configurations. This seems to be the\nbest we can do until the transition to page types in complete for\npage_pool pages.\n\nv2:\n- Make sure there's at least 8 bits available and that the PAGE_OFFSET\n  bit calculation doesn't wrap",
