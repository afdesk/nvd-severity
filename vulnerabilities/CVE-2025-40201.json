  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernel/sys.c: fix the racy usage of task_lock(tsk->group_leader) in sys_prlimit64() paths\n\nThe usage of task_lock(tsk->group_leader) in sys_prlimit64()->do_prlimit()\npath is very broken.\n\nsys_prlimit64() does get_task_struct(tsk) but this only protects task_struct\nitself. If tsk != current and tsk is not a leader, this process can exit/exec\nand task_lock(tsk->group_leader) may use the already freed task_struct.\n\nAnother problem is that sys_prlimit64() can race with mt-exec which changes\n->group_leader. In this case do_prlimit() may take the wrong lock, or (worse)\n->group_leader may change between task_lock() and task_unlock().\n\nChange sys_prlimit64() to take tasklist_lock when necessary. This is not\nnice, but I don't see a better fix for -stable.",
