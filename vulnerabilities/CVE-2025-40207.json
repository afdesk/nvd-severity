  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: v4l2-subdev: Fix alloc failure check in v4l2_subdev_call_state_try()\n\nv4l2_subdev_call_state_try() macro allocates a subdev state with\n__v4l2_subdev_state_alloc(), but does not check the returned value. If\n__v4l2_subdev_state_alloc fails, it returns an ERR_PTR, and that would\ncause v4l2_subdev_call_state_try() to crash.\n\nAdd proper error handling to v4l2_subdev_call_state_try().",
