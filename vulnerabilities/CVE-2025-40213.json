  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: MGMT: fix crash in set_mesh_sync and set_mesh_complete\n\nThere is a BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in set_mesh_sync due to\nmemcpy from badly declared on-stack flexible array.\n\nAnother crash is in set_mesh_complete() due to double list_del via\nmgmt_pending_valid + mgmt_pending_remove.\n\nUse DEFINE_FLEX to declare the flexible array right, and don't memcpy\noutside bounds.\n\nAs mgmt_pending_valid removes the cmd from list, use mgmt_pending_free,\nand also report status on error.",
