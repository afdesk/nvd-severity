  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/vaddr: do not repeat pte_offset_map_lock() until success\n\nDAMON's virtual address space operation set implementation (vaddr) calls\npte_offset_map_lock() inside the page table walk callback function.  This\nis for reading and writing page table accessed bits.  If\npte_offset_map_lock() fails, it retries by returning the page table walk\ncallback function with ACTION_AGAIN.\n\npte_offset_map_lock() can continuously fail if the target is a pmd\nmigration entry, though.  Hence it could cause an infinite page table walk\nif the migration cannot be done until the page table walk is finished. \nThis indeed caused a soft lockup when CPU hotplugging and DAMON were\nrunning in parallel.\n\nAvoid the infinite loop by simply not retrying the page table walk.  DAMON\nis promising only a best-effort accuracy, so missing access to such pages\nis no problem.",
