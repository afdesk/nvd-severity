  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/sysfs: catch commit test ctx alloc failure\n\nPatch series \"mm/damon/sysfs: fix commit test damon_ctx [de]allocation\".\n\nDAMON sysfs interface dynamically allocates and uses a damon_ctx object\nfor testing if given inputs for online DAMON parameters update is valid.\nThe object is being used without an allocation failure check, and leaked\nwhen the test succeeds.  Fix the two bugs.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThe damon_ctx for testing online DAMON parameters commit inputs is used\nwithout its allocation failure check.  This could result in an invalid\nmemory access.  Fix it by directly returning an error when the allocation\nfailed.",
