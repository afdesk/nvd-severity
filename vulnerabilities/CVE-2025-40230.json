  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: prevent poison consumption when splitting THP\n\nWhen performing memory error injection on a THP (Transparent Huge Page)\nmapped to userspace on an x86 server, the kernel panics with the following\ntrace.  The expected behavior is to terminate the affected process instead\nof panicking the kernel, as the x86 Machine Check code can recover from an\nin-userspace #MC.\n\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 3: bd80000000070134\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffff8372f8bc> {memchr_inv+0x4c/0xf0}\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC afff7bbff88a ADDR 1d301b000 MISC 80 PPIN 1e741e77539027db\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:d06d0 TIME 1758093249 SOCKET 0 APIC 0 microcode 80000320\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check\n\nThe root cause of this panic is that handling a memory failure triggered\nby an in-userspace #MC necessitates splitting the THP.  The splitting\nprocess employs a mechanism, implemented in\ntry_to_map_unused_to_zeropage(), which reads the pages in the THP to\nidentify zero-filled pages.  However, reading the pages in the THP results\nin a second in-kernel #MC, occurring before the initial memory_failure()\ncompletes, ultimately leading to a kernel panic.  See the kernel panic\ncall trace on the two #MCs.\n\n  First Machine Check occurs // [1]\n    memory_failure()         // [2]\n      try_to_split_thp_page()\n        split_huge_page()\n          split_huge_page_to_list_to_order()\n            __folio_split()  // [3]\n              remap_page()\n                remove_migration_ptes()\n                  remove_migration_pte()\n                    try_to_map_unused_to_zeropage()  // [4]\n                      memchr_inv()                   // [5]\n                        Second Machine Check occurs  // [6]\n                          Kernel panic\n\n[1] Triggered by accessing a hardware-poisoned THP in userspace, which is\n    typically recoverable by terminating the affected process.\n\n[2] Call folio_set_has_hwpoisoned() before try_to_split_thp_page().\n\n[3] Pass the RMP_USE_SHARED_ZEROPAGE remap flag to remap_page().\n\n[4] Try to map the unused THP to zeropage.\n\n[5] Re-access pages in the hw-poisoned THP in the kernel.\n\n[6] Triggered in-kernel, leading to a panic kernel.\n\nIn Step[2], memory_failure() sets the poisoned flag on the page in the THP\nby TestSetPageHWPoison() before calling try_to_split_thp_page().\n\nAs suggested by David Hildenbrand, fix this panic by not accessing to the\npoisoned page in the THP during zeropage identification, while continuing\nto scan unaffected pages in the THP for possible zeropage mapping.  This\nprevents a second in-kernel #MC that would cause kernel panic in Step[4].\n\nThanks to Andrew Zaborowski for his initial work on fixing this issue.",
