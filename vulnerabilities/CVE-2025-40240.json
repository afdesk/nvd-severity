  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: avoid NULL dereference when chunk data buffer is missing\n\nchunk->skb pointer is dereferenced in the if-block where it's supposed\nto be NULL only.\n\nchunk->skb can only be NULL if chunk->head_skb is not. Check for frag_list\ninstead and do it just before replacing chunk->skb. We're sure that\notherwise chunk->skb is non-NULL because of outer if() condition.",
