  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngfs2: Fix unlikely race in gdlm_put_lock\n\nIn gdlm_put_lock(), there is a small window of time in which the\nDFL_UNMOUNT flag has been set but the lockspace hasn't been released,\nyet.  In that window, dlm may still call gdlm_ast() and gdlm_bast().\nTo prevent it from dereferencing freed glock objects, only free the\nglock if the lockspace has actually been released.",
