  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnios2: ensure that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits\n\nOn nios2, with CONFIG_FLATMEM set, the kernel relies on\nmemblock_get_current_limit() to determine the limits of mem_map, in\nparticular for max_low_pfn.\nUnfortunately, memblock.current_limit is only default initialized to\nMEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE at this point of the bootup, potentially leading\nto situations where max_low_pfn can erroneously exceed the value of\nmax_pfn and, thus, the valid range of available DRAM.\n\nThis can in turn cause kernel-level paging failures, e.g.:\n\n[   76.900000] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 20303000\n[   76.900000] ea = c0080890, ra = c000462c, cause = 14\n[   76.900000] Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops\n[   76.900000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops ]---\n\nThis patch fixes this by pre-calculating memblock.current_limit\nbased on the upper limits of the available memory ranges via\nadjust_lowmem_bounds, a simplified version of the equivalent\nimplementation within the arm architecture.",
