  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: qlogic/qede: fix potential out-of-bounds read in qede_tpa_cont() and qede_tpa_end()\n\nThe loops in 'qede_tpa_cont()' and 'qede_tpa_end()', iterate\nover 'cqe->len_list[]' using only a zero-length terminator as\nthe stopping condition. If the terminator was missing or\nmalformed, the loop could run past the end of the fixed-size array.\n\nAdd an explicit bound check using ARRAY_SIZE() in both loops to prevent\na potential out-of-bounds access.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
