  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/ctcm: Fix double-kfree\n\nThe function 'mpc_rcvd_sweep_req(mpcginfo)' is called conditionally\nfrom function 'ctcmpc_unpack_skb'. It frees passed mpcginfo.\nAfter that a call to function 'kfree' in function 'ctcmpc_unpack_skb'\nfrees it again.\n\nRemove 'kfree' call in function 'mpc_rcvd_sweep_req(mpcginfo)'.\n\nBug detected by the clang static analyzer.",
