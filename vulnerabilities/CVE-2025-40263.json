  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: cros_ec_keyb - fix an invalid memory access\n\nIf cros_ec_keyb_register_matrix() isn't called (due to\n`buttons_switches_only`) in cros_ec_keyb_probe(), `ckdev->idev` remains\nNULL.  An invalid memory access is observed in cros_ec_keyb_process()\nwhen receiving an EC_MKBP_EVENT_KEY_MATRIX event in cros_ec_keyb_work()\nin such case.\n\n  Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address 0000000000000028\n  ...\n  x3 : 0000000000000000 x2 : 0000000000000000\n  x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : 0000000000000000\n  Call trace:\n  input_event\n  cros_ec_keyb_work\n  blocking_notifier_call_chain\n  ec_irq_thread\n\nIt's still unknown about why the kernel receives such malformed event,\nin any cases, the kernel shouldn't access `ckdev->idev` and friends if\nthe driver doesn't intend to initialize them.",
