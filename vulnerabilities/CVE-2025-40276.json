  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panthor: Flush shmem writes before mapping buffers CPU-uncached\n\nThe shmem layer zeroes out the new pages using cached mappings, and if\nwe don't CPU-flush we might leave dirty cachelines behind, leading to\npotential data leaks and/or asynchronous buffer corruption when dirty\ncachelines are evicted.",
