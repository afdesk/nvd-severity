  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: fix improper check of dentry.stream.valid_size\n\nWe found an infinite loop bug in the exFAT file system that can lead to a\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) condition. When a dentry in an exFAT filesystem is\nmalformed, the following system calls \u2014 SYS_openat, SYS_ftruncate, and\nSYS_pwrite64 \u2014 can cause the kernel to hang.\n\nRoot cause analysis shows that the size validation code in exfat_find()\ndoes not check whether dentry.stream.valid_size is negative. As a result,\nthe system calls mentioned above can succeed and eventually trigger the DoS\nissue.\n\nThis patch adds a check for negative dentry.stream.valid_size to prevent\nthis vulnerability.",
