  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices\n\nPreviously, APU platforms (and other scenarios with uninitialized VRAM managers)\ntriggered a NULL pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`. The root\ncause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,\nbut that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains\nuninitialized (NULL) on APUs\u2014since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully\nset up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to\nacquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to\na kernel OOPS.\n\n1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in\n   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for\n   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized\n   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately\u2014skipping VRAM-specific\n   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.\n\n2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info\n   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM\n   usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is\n   NULL.\n\n3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)\n   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the\n   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set\n   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).\n\nThis approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it:\n- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs),\n- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function,\n- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized\n  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).\n\nv4: use ttm_resource_manager_used(&adev->mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking the adev->gmc.is_app_apu flag (Christian)",
