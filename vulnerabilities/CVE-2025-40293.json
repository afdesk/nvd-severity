  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommufd: Don't overflow during division for dirty tracking\n\nIf pgshift is 63 then BITS_PER_TYPE(*bitmap->bitmap) * pgsize will overflow\nto 0 and this triggers divide by 0.\n\nIn this case the index should just be 0, so reorganize things to divide\nby shift and avoid hitting any overflows.",
