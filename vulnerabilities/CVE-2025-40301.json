  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_event: validate skb length for unknown CC opcode\n\nIn hci_cmd_complete_evt(), if the command complete event has an unknown\nopcode, we assume the first byte of the remaining skb->data contains the\nreturn status. However, parameter data has previously been pulled in\nhci_event_func(), which may leave the skb empty. If so, using skb->data[0]\nfor the return status uses un-init memory.\n\nThe fix is to check skb->len before using skb->data.",
