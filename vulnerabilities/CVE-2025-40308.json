  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: bcsp: receive data only if registered\n\nCurrently, bcsp_recv() can be called even when the BCSP protocol has not\nbeen registered. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference, as shown in\nthe following stack trace:\n\n    KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000108-0x000000000000010f]\n    RIP: 0010:bcsp_recv+0x13d/0x1740 drivers/bluetooth/hci_bcsp.c:590\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     hci_uart_tty_receive+0x194/0x220 drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c:627\n     tiocsti+0x23c/0x2c0 drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2290\n     tty_ioctl+0x626/0xde0 drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2706\n     vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n     __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:907 [inline]\n     __se_sys_ioctl+0xfc/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:893\n     do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n     do_syscall_64+0xfa/0x3b0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n\nTo prevent this, ensure that the HCI_UART_REGISTERED flag is set before\nprocessing received data. If the protocol is not registered, return\n-EUNATCH.",
