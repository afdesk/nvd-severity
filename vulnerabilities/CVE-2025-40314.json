  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdns3: gadget: Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget\n\nIn the __cdnsp_gadget_init() and cdnsp_gadget_exit() functions, the gadget\nstructure (pdev->gadget) was freed before its endpoints.\nThe endpoints are linked via the ep_list in the gadget structure.\nFreeing the gadget first leaves dangling pointers in the endpoint list.\nWhen the endpoints are subsequently freed, this results in a use-after-free.\n\nFix:\nBy separating the usb_del_gadget_udc() operation into distinct \"del\" and\n\"put\" steps, cdnsp_gadget_free_endpoints() can be executed prior to the\nfinal release of the gadget structure with usb_put_gadget().\n\nA patch similar to bb9c74a5bd14(\"usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure\n only after freeing endpoints\").",
