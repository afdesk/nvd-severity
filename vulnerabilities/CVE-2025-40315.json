  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.\n\nA race condition occurs when ffs_func_eps_enable() runs concurrently\nwith ffs_data_reset(). The ffs_data_clear() called in ffs_data_reset()\nsets ffs->epfiles to NULL before resetting ffs->eps_count to 0, leading\nto a NULL pointer dereference when accessing epfile->ep in\nffs_func_eps_enable() after successful usb_ep_enable().\n\nThe ffs->epfiles pointer is set to NULL in both ffs_data_clear() and\nffs_data_close() functions, and its modification is protected by the\nspinlock ffs->eps_lock. And the whole ffs_func_eps_enable() function\nis also protected by ffs->eps_lock.\n\nThus, add NULL pointer handling for ffs->epfiles in the\nffs_func_eps_enable() function to fix issues",
