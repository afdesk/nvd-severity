  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: Fix device use-after-free on unbind\n\nA recent change fixed device reference leaks when looking up drm\nplatform device driver data during bind() but failed to remove a partial\nfix which had been added by commit 80805b62ea5b (\"drm/mediatek: Fix\nkobject put for component sub-drivers\").\n\nThis results in a reference imbalance on component bind() failures and\non unbind() which could lead to a user-after-free.\n\nMake sure to only drop the references after retrieving the driver data\nby effectively reverting the previous partial fix.\n\nNote that holding a reference to a device does not prevent its driver\ndata from going away so there is no point in keeping the reference.",
