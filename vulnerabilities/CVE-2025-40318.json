  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_sync: fix race in hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once\n\nhci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once() does lookup and then cancel\nthe entry under two separate lock sections. Meanwhile,\nhci_cmd_sync_work() can also delete the same entry,\nleading to double list_del() and \"UAF\".\n\nFix this by holding cmd_sync_work_lock across both\nlookup and cancel, so that the entry cannot be removed\nconcurrently.",
