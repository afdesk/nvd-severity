  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Sync pending IRQ work before freeing ring buffer\n\nFix a race where irq_work can be queued in bpf_ringbuf_commit()\nbut the ring buffer is freed before the work executes.\nIn the syzbot reproducer, a BPF program attached to sched_switch\ntriggers bpf_ringbuf_commit(), queuing an irq_work. If the ring buffer\nis freed before this work executes, the irq_work thread may accesses\nfreed memory.\nCalling `irq_work_sync(&rb->work)` ensures that all pending irq_work\ncomplete before freeing the buffer.",
