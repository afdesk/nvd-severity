  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: bitblit: bound-check glyph index in bit_putcs*\n\nbit_putcs_aligned()/unaligned() derived the glyph pointer from the\ncharacter value masked by 0xff/0x1ff, which may exceed the actual font's\nglyph count and read past the end of the built-in font array.\nClamp the index to the actual glyph count before computing the address.\n\nThis fixes a global out-of-bounds read reported by syzbot.",
