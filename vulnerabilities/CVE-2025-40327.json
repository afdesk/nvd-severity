  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Fix system hang caused by cpu-clock usage\n\ncpu-clock usage by the async-profiler tool can trigger a system hang,\nwhich got bisected back to the following commit by Octavia Togami:\n\n  18dbcbfabfff (\"perf: Fix the POLL_HUP delivery breakage\") causes this issue\n\nThe root cause of the hang is that cpu-clock is a special type of SW\nevent which relies on hrtimers. The __perf_event_overflow() callback\nis invoked from the hrtimer handler for cpu-clock events, and\n__perf_event_overflow() tries to call cpu_clock_event_stop()\nto stop the event, which calls htimer_cancel() to cancel the hrtimer.\n\nBut that's a recursion into the hrtimer code from a hrtimer handler,\nwhich (unsurprisingly) deadlocks.\n\nTo fix this bug, use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() instead, and set\nthe PERF_HES_STOPPED flag, which causes perf_swevent_hrtimer()\nto stop the event once it sees the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag.\n\n[ mingo: Fixed the comments and improved the changelog. ]",
