  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/gpusvm: fix hmm_pfn_to_map_order() usage\n\nHandle the case where the hmm range partially covers a huge page (like\n2M), otherwise we can potentially end up doing something nasty like\nmapping memory which is outside the range, and maybe not even mapped by\nthe mm. Fix is based on the xe userptr code, which in a future patch\nwill directly use gpusvm, so needs alignment here.\n\nv2:\n  - Add kernel-doc (Matt B)\n  - s/fls/ilog2/ (Thomas)",
