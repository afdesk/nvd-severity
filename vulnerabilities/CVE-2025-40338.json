  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: Intel: avs: Do not share the name pointer between components\n\nBy sharing 'name' directly, tearing down components may lead to\nuse-after-free errors. Duplicate the name to avoid that.\n\nAt the same time, update the order of operations - since commit\ncee28113db17 (\"ASoC: dmaengine_pcm: Allow passing component name via\nconfig\") the framework does not override component->name if set before\ninvoking the initializer.",
