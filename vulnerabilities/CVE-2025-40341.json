  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfutex: Don't leak robust_list pointer on exec race\n\nsys_get_robust_list() and compat_get_robust_list() use ptrace_may_access()\nto check if the calling task is allowed to access another task's\nrobust_list pointer. This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the\ntarget process.\n\nDuring exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a\nprivileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings\nmay change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before\nthis transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information\nafter the target becomes privileged.\n\nA racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which\nptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a\nprivileged state via exec().\n\nFor example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a\nsetuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T\nis still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions\nbased on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec\nimmediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory\nmappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T->robust_list\nwithout synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a\nnow-privileged process.\n\nThis violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could\nexpose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger\nexploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized\ndisclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a\npotential security risk.\n\nTake a read lock on signal->exec_update_lock prior to invoking\nptrace_may_access() and accessing the robust_list/compat_robust_list.\nThis ensures that the target task's exec state remains stable during the\ncheck, allowing for consistent and synchronized validation of\ncredentials.",
