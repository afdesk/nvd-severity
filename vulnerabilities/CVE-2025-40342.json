  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-fc: use lock accessing port_state and rport state\n\nnvme_fc_unregister_remote removes the remote port on a lport object at\nany point in time when there is no active association. This races with\nwith the reconnect logic, because nvme_fc_create_association is not\ntaking a lock to check the port_state and atomically increase the\nactive count on the rport.",
