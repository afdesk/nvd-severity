  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narch_topology: Fix incorrect error check in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()\n\nFix incorrect use of PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()\nwhich causes the code to proceed with NULL clock pointers. The current\nlogic uses !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) which evaluates to true for both\nvalid pointers and NULL, leading to potential NULL pointer dereference\nin clk_get_rate().\n\nPer include/linux/err.h documentation, PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(ptr) returns:\n\"The error code within @ptr if it is an error pointer; 0 otherwise.\"\n\nThis means PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() returns 0 for both valid pointers AND NULL\npointers. Therefore !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) evaluates to true (proceed)\nwhen cpu_clk is either valid or NULL, causing clk_get_rate(NULL) to be\ncalled when of_clk_get() returns NULL.\n\nReplace with !IS_ERR_OR_NULL(cpu_clk) which only proceeds for valid\npointers, preventing potential NULL pointer dereference in clk_get_rate().",
