  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: RX, Fix generating skb from non-linear xdp_buff for striding RQ\n\nXDP programs can change the layout of an xdp_buff through\nbpf_xdp_adjust_tail() and bpf_xdp_adjust_head(). Therefore, the driver\ncannot assume the size of the linear data area nor fragments. Fix the\nbug in mlx5 by generating skb according to xdp_buff after XDP programs\nrun.\n\nCurrently, when handling multi-buf XDP, the mlx5 driver assumes the\nlayout of an xdp_buff to be unchanged. That is, the linear data area\ncontinues to be empty and fragments remain the same. This may cause\nthe driver to generate erroneous skb or triggering a kernel\nwarning. When an XDP program added linear data through\nbpf_xdp_adjust_head(), the linear data will be ignored as\nmlx5e_build_linear_skb() builds an skb without linear data and then\npull data from fragments to fill the linear data area. When an XDP\nprogram has shrunk the non-linear data through bpf_xdp_adjust_tail(),\nthe delta passed to __pskb_pull_tail() may exceed the actual nonlinear\ndata size and trigger the BUG_ON in it.\n\nTo fix the issue, first record the original number of fragments. If the\nnumber of fragments changes after the XDP program runs, rewind the end\nfragment pointer by the difference and recalculate the truesize. Then,\nbuild the skb with the linear data area matching the xdp_buff. Finally,\nonly pull data in if there is non-linear data and fill the linear part\nup to 256 bytes.",
