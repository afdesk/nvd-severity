  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ipv6: fix field-spanning memcpy warning in AH output\n\nFix field-spanning memcpy warnings in ah6_output() and\nah6_output_done() where extension headers are copied to/from IPv6\naddress fields, triggering fortify-string warnings about writes beyond\nthe 16-byte address fields.\n\n  memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 40) of single field \"&top_iph->saddr\" at net/ipv6/ah6.c:439 (size 16)\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 8838 at net/ipv6/ah6.c:439 ah6_output+0xe7e/0x14e0 net/ipv6/ah6.c:439\n\nThe warnings are false positives as the extension headers are\nintentionally placed after the IPv6 header in memory. Fix by properly\ncopying addresses and extension headers separately, and introduce\nhelper functions to avoid code duplication.",
