  "Description": "If a DHCPv4 client sends a request with some specific options, and Kea fails to find an appropriate subnet for the client, the `kea-dhcp4` process will abort with an assertion failure.  This happens only if the client request is unicast directly to Kea; broadcast messages do not cause the problem.\nThis issue affects Kea versions 2.7.1 through 2.7.9, 3.0.0, and 3.1.0.",
