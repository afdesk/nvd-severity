{
  "Description": "Use of entitlement \"com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation\" and lack of launch and library load constraints allows to substitute a legitimate dylib with malicious one. A local attacker with unprivileged access can execute the application with altered dynamic library successfully bypassing Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC). Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted-permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.\n\nThis issue affects DaVinci Resolve on macOS in all versions.\nLast tested version: 19.1.3",
