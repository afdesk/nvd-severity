  "Description": "Affected products do not properly enforce TCP sequence number validation in specific scenarios but accept values within a broad range. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker e.g. to interfere with connection setup, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attack succeeds only if an attacker can inject IP packets with spoofed addresses at precisely timed moments, and it affects only TCP-based services.",
