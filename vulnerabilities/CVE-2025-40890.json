  "Description": "A Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was discovered in the Dashboards functionality due to improper validation of an input parameter.\n\n\n\nAn authenticated low-privilege user can craft a malicious dashboard containing a JavaScript payload and share it with victim users, or a victim can be socially engineered to import a malicious dashboard template. When the victim views or imports the dashboard, the XSS executes in their browser context, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions as the victim, such as modify application data, disrupt application availability, and access limited sensitive information.",
