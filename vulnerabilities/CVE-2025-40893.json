  "Description": "A Stored HTML Injection vulnerability was discovered in the Asset List functionality due to improper validation of network traffic data. An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted network packets to inject HTML tags into asset attributes. When a victim views the affected assets in the Asset List (and similar functions), the injected HTML renders in their browser, enabling phishing and possibly open redirect attacks. Full XSS exploitation and direct information disclosure are prevented by the existing input validation and Content Security Policy configuration.",
