  "Description": "Apache::AuthAny::Cookie v0.201 or earlier for Perl generates session ids insecurely.\n\nSession ids are generated using an MD5 hash of the epoch time and a call to the built-in rand function. The epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.\n\nPredicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.",
