  "Description": "Incorrect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in Hiberus Sintra. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows browsers to make cross-domain requests in a controlled manner. This request has an \u201cOrigin\u201d header that identifies the domain making the initial request and defines the protocol between a browser and a server to see if the request is allowed. An attacker can exploit this and potentially perform privileged actions and access confidential information when Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is enabled.",
