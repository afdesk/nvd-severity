{
  "Description": "Vulnerability in the access control system of the GAMS licensing system that allows unlimited valid licenses to be generated, bypassing any usage restrictions. The validator uses an insecure checksum algorithm; knowing this algorithm and the format of the license lines, an attacker can recalculate the checksum and generate a valid license to grant themselves full privileges without credentials or access to the source code, allowing them unrestricted access to GAMS's mathematical models and commercial solvers.",
