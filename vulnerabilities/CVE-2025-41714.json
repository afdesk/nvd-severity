  "Description": "The upload endpoint insufficiently validates the 'Upload-Key' request header. By supplying path traversal sequences, an authenticated attacker can cause the server to create upload-related artifacts outside the intended storage location. In certain configurations this enables arbitrary file write and may be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.",
