  "Description": "An information exposure vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks User-ID Credential Agent (Windows-based) can expose the service account password under specific non-default configurations. This allows an unprivileged Domain User to escalate privileges by exploiting the account\u2019s permissions. The impact varies by configuration:\n  *  Minimally Privileged Accounts: Enable disruption of User-ID Credential Agent operations (e.g., uninstalling or disabling the agent service), weakening network security policies that leverage  Credential Phishing Prevention https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/advanced-url-filtering/administration/url-filtering-features/credential-phishing-prevention  under a  Domain Credential Filter https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/advanced-url-filtering/administration/url-filtering-features/credential-phishing-prevention/methods-to-check-for-corporate-credential-submissions  configuration.\n  *  Elevated Accounts (Server Operator, Domain Join, Legacy Features): Permit increased impacts, including server control (e.g., shutdown/restart), domain manipulation (e.g., rogue computer objects), and network compromise via reconnaissance or client probing.",
