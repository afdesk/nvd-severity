  "Description": "Some endpoints in vulnerability-lookup that modified \napplication state (e.g. changing database entries, user data, \nconfigurations, or other privileged actions) may have been accessible \nvia HTTP GET requests without requiring a CSRF token. This flaw leaves \nthe application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks:\n an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious \nwebsite could cause the user\u2019s browser to issue GET requests that \nperform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their \nauthenticated session.\n\n\nBecause the server would treat these GET requests as valid (since no \nCSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker \ncould exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out\n other unauthorized actions without needing the user\u2019s explicit consent \nor awareness.\u00a0\nThe fix ensures that all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST \nrequests and include a valid CSRF token. This enforces that state \nchanges cannot be triggered by arbitrary cross-site GET requests.\u00a0This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup: before 2.18.0.",
