  "Description": "Due to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SAP Business Connector, an unauthenticated attacker could generate a malicious link and make it publicly accessible. If an authenticated victim accesses this link, the injected input is processed during web page generation, resulting in the execution of malicious content in the victim's browser context. This could allow the attacker to access or modify information within the victim\ufffds browser scope, impacting confidentiality and integrity, while availability remains unaffected",
