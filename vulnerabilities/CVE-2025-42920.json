  "Description": "Due to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SAP Supplier Relationship Management, an unauthenticated attacker could generate a malicious link and make it publicly accessible. If an authenticated victim clicks on the link, the injected input is processed during the page generation, resulting in the execution of malicious content. This execution allows the attacker to access and modify information within the victim's browser scope, impacting confidentiality and integrity, while availability remains unaffected.",
