  "Description": "Due to a missing authorization check in SAP NetWeaver Application server for ABAP, an authenticated user with high privileges could exploit the insufficient validation of user permissions to access sensitive database tables. By leveraging overly permissive access configurations, unauthorized reading of critical data is possible, resulting in a significant impact on the confidentiality of the information stored. However, the integrity and availability of the system remain unaffected.",
