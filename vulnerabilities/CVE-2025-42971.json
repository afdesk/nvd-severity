  "Description": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in SAPCAR allowing an attacker to craft malicious SAPCAR archives. When a high privileged victim extracts this malicious archive, it gets processed by SAPCAR on their system, resulting in out-of-bounds memory read and write. This could lead to file extraction and file overwrite outside the intended directories. This vulnerability has low impact on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the application.",
