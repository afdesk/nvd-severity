  "Description": "Due to an open redirect vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP, an unauthenticated attacker could craft a URL link embedding a malicious script at a location not properly sanitized. When a victim clicks on this link, the script executes within the victim's browser, redirecting them to a site controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to access and/or modify restricted information related to the web client. While the vulnerability poses no impact on data availability, it presents a considerable risk to confidentiality and integrity.",
