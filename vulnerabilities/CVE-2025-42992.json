  "Description": "SAPCAR allows an attacker logged in with high privileges to create a malicious SAR archive in SAPCAR. This could enable the attacker to exploit critical files and directory permissions without breaking signature validation, resulting in potential privilege escalation. This has high impact on integrity, but low impact on confidentiality and availability of the system.",
