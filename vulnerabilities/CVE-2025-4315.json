  "Description": "The CubeWP \u2013 All-in-One Dynamic Content Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.23. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to update arbitrary user meta through the update_user_meta() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.",
