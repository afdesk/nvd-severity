  "Description": "The Companion Auto Update plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018update_delay_days\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
