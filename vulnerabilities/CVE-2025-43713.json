  "Description": "ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar before 2025-03-31 allow deserialization attacks against .NET remoting. These are Windows system services that support license key management and deprecated Windows network authentication. The services are implemented with .NET remoting and can be exploited via well-known deserialization techniques inherent in the technology. Because the services run with SYSTEM-level rights, exploits can be crafted to achieve escalation of privilege and arbitrary code execution. This affects DataGate for SQL Server 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Component Suite 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Monitor 17.0.26.0 and 16.0.65.0, DataGate WebPak 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Monarch for .NET 11.4.50.0 and 10.0.62.0, Encore RPG 4.1.36.0, Visual RPG .NET FW 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG .NET FW Windows Deployment 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, WingsRPG 11.0.38.0 and 10.0.95.0, Mobile RPG 11.0.35.0 and 10.0.94.0, Monarch Framework for .NET FW 11.0.36.0 and 10.0.89.0, Browser Terminal 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG Classic 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, Visual RPG Deployment 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, and DataGate Studio 17.0.38.0 and 16.0.104.0.",
