  "Description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to command injection. The variables\u00a0exp_dir1, among others, take user input and\u00a0pass\u00a0it to the\u00a0click_train\u00a0function, which\u00a0concatenates them into a command that is\u00a0run\u00a0on the server. This can lead to arbitrary command execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",
