  "Description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to code injection. The\u00a0ckpt_path2\u00a0variable\u00a0takes user input\u00a0(e.g. a path to a model) and\u00a0passes\u00a0it to\u00a0change_info_\u00a0function, which opens and reads the file on the given path (except it changes the final on the path to\u00a0train.log), and\u00a0passes the contents of the file to\u00a0eval, which can lead to remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",
