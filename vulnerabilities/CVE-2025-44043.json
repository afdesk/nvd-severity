  "Description": "Keyoti SearchUnit prior to 9.0.0. is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in /Keyoti_SearchEngine_Web_Common/SearchService.svc/GetResults and /Keyoti_SearchEngine_Web_Common/SearchService.svc/GetLocationAndContentCategories. An attacker can specify their own SMB server as the indexDirectory value when making POST requests to the affected components. In doing so an attacker can get the SearchUnit server to read and write configuration and log files from/to the attackers server.",
