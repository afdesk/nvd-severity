  "Description": "Certain Draytek products are affected by Insecure Configuration. This affects AP903 v1.4.18 and AP912C v1.4.9 and AP918R v1.4.9. The setting of the password property in the ripd.conf configuration file sets a hardcoded weak password, posing a security risk. An attacker with network access could exploit this to gain unauthorized control over the routing daemon, potentially altering network routes or intercepting traffic.",
