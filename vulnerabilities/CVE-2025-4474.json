  "Description": "The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the fed_admin_setting_form_function() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the plugin\u2019s 'register' role setting to make new user registrations default to the administrator role, leading to an elevation of privileges to that of an administrator.",
