  "Description": "The IDonate \u2013 Blood Donation, Request And Donor Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the idonate_donor_profile() function in versions 2.1.5 to 2.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to hijack any account by reassigning its email address (via the donor_id they supply) and then triggering a password reset, ultimately granting themselves full administrator privileges.",
