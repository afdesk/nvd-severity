  "Description": "An issue was discovered in CommScope Ruckus Unleashed prior to 200.15.6.12.304, where an authenticated request to the management endpoint `/admin/_cmdstat.jsp` discloses the administrator password in a trivially reversible obfuscated form. The same obfuscation method persists in configuration prior to 200.18.7.1.302, allowing anyone who obtains the system configuration to recover the plaintext credentials.",
