  "Description": "In IZArc through 4.5, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. When a user performs an extraction from an archive file that bears Mark-of-the-Web, Mark-of-the-Web is not propagated to the extracted files. NOTE: this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file's content.",
  "Severity": "MEDIUM",
