  "Description": "Certain build processes for libuv and Node.js for 32-bit systems, such as for the nodejs binary package through nodejs_20.19.0+dfsg-2_i386.deb for Debian GNU/Linux, have an inconsistent off_t size (e.g., building on i386 Debian always uses _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 for the libuv dynamic library, but uses the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS global system default of 32 for nodejs), leading to out-of-bounds access. NOTE: this is not a problem in the Node.js software itself. In particular, the Node.js website's download page does not offer prebuilt Node.js for Linux on i386.",
