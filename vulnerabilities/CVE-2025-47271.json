  "Description": "The OZI action is a GitHub Action that publishes releases to PyPI and mirror releases, signature bundles, and provenance in a tagged release. In versions 1.13.2 through 1.13.5, potentially untrusted data flows into PR creation logic. A malicious actor could construct a branch name that injects arbitrary code. This is patched in 1.13.6. As a workaround, one may downgrade to a version prior to 1.13.2.",
