  "Description": "In Wing FTP Server before 7.4.4. the user and admin web interfaces mishandle '\\0' bytes, ultimately allowing injection of arbitrary Lua code into user session files. This can be used to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the FTP service (root or SYSTEM by default). This is thus a remote code execution vulnerability that guarantees a total server compromise. This is also exploitable via anonymous FTP accounts.",
