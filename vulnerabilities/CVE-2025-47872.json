  "Description": "The public-facing product registration endpoint server responds \ndifferently depending on whether the S/N is valid and unregistered, \nvalid but already registered, or does not exist in the database. \nCombined with the fact that serial numbers are sequentially assigned, \nthis allows an attacker to gain information on the product registration \nstatus of different S/Ns.",
