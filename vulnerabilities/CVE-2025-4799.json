  "Description": "The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to lack of restriction on the directory a file can be deleted from in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability can be paired with CVE-2025-4798 to delete any file within the WordPress root directory.",
