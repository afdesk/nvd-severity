  "Description": "OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. Version 3.3.2 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow during a read operation due to bad pointer math when decompressing DWAA-packed scan-line EXR files with a maliciously forged chunk. This is fixed in version 3.3.3.",
