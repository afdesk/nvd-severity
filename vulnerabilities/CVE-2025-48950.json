  "Description": "MaxKB is an open-source AI assistant for enterprise. Prior to version 1.10.8-lts, Sandbox only restricts the execution permissions of binary files in common directories, such as `/bin,/usr/bin`, etc. Therefore, attackers can exploit some files with execution permissions in non blacklisted directories to carry out attacks. Version 1.10.8-lts fixes the issue.",
