  "Description": "KDE Konsole before 25.04.2 allows remote code execution in a certain scenario. It supports loading URLs from the scheme handlers such as a ssh:// or telnet:// or rlogin:// URL. This can be executed regardless of whether the ssh, telnet, or rlogin binary is available. In this mode, there is a code path where if that binary is not available, Konsole falls back to using /bin/bash for the given arguments (i.e., the URL) provided. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
