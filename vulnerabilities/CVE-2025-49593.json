Prior to STS version 2.31.0 and LTS version 2.27.7, if a Portainer administrator can be convinced to register a malicious container registry, or an existing container registry can be taken over, HTTP Headers (including registry authentication credentials or Portainer session tokens) may be leaked to that registry. This issue has been patched in STS version 2.31.0 and LTS version 2.27.7.",
