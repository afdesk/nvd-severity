{
  "Description": "Conjur provides secrets management and application identity for infrastructure. An authenticated attacker who is able to load policy can use the policy yaml parser to reference files on the Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted server. These references may be used as reconnaissance to better understand the folder structure of the Secrets Manager/Conjur server or to have the yaml parser include files on the server in the yaml that is processed as the policy loads. This issue affects Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted (formerly Conjur Enterprise) prior to versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 and Conjur OSS prior to version 1.22.1. Conjur OSS version 1.22.1 and Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 fix the issue.",
