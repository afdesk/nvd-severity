  "Description": "The Workreap plugin for WordPress, used by the Workreap - Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'workreap_temp_upload_to_media' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
