  "Description": "RabbitMQ is a messaging and streaming broker. In versions 3.13.7 and prior, RabbitMQ is logging authorization headers in plaintext encoded in base64. When querying RabbitMQ api with HTTP/s with basic authentication it creates logs with all headers in request, including authorization headers which show base64 encoded username:password. This is easy to decode and afterwards could be used to obtain control to the system depending on credentials. This issue has been patched in version 4.0.8.",
