  "Description": "A deserialization vulnerability exists in Volcengine's verl 3.0.0, specifically in the scripts/model_merger.py script when using the \"fsdp\" backend. The script calls torch.load() with weights_only=False on user-supplied .pt files, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code if a maliciously crafted model file is loaded. An attacker can exploit this by convincing a victim to download and place a malicious model file in a local directory with a specific filename pattern. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the script.",
