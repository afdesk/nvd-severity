  "Description": "CS Cart 4.18.3 is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The user profile functionality allows enabling or disabling stickers through a parameter (company_id) sent in the request. However, this operation is not properly validated on the server side. An authenticated user can manipulate the request to target other users' accounts and toggle the sticker setting by modifying the company_id or other object identifiers.",
