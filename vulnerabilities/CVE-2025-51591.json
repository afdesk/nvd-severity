  "Description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in JGM Pandoc v3.6.4 allows attackers to gain access to and compromise the whole infrastructure via injecting a crafted iframe. Note: Some users have stated that Pandoc by default can retrieve and parse untrusted HTML content which can enable SSRF vulnerabilities. Using the \u2018--sandbox\u2019 option or \u2018pandoc-server\u2019 can mitigate such vulnerabilities. Using pandoc with an external \u2018--pdf-engine\u2019 can also enable SSRF vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2022-35583 in wkhtmltopdf.",
