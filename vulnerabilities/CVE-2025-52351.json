  "Description": "Aikaan IoT management platform v3.25.0325-5-g2e9c59796 sends a newly generated password to users in plaintext via email and also includes the same password as a query parameter in the account activation URL (e.g., https://domain.com/activate=xyz). This practice can result in password exposure via browser history, proxy logs, referrer headers, and email caching. The vulnerability impacts user credential confidentiality during initial onboarding.",
