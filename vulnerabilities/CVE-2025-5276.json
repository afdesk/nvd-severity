  "Description": "All versions of the package mcp-markdownify-server are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the Markdownify.get() function. An attacker can craft a prompt that, once accessed by the MCP host, can invoke the webpage-to-markdown, bing-search-to-markdown, and youtube-to-markdown tools to issue requests and read the responses to attacker-controlled URLs, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
