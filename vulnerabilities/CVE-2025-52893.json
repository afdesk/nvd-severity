  "Description": "OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. OpenBao before v2.3.0 may leak sensitive information in logs when processing malformed data. This is separate from the earlier HCSEC-2025-09 / CVE-2025-4166. This issue has been fixed in OpenBao v2.3.0 and later. Like with HCSEC-2025-09, there is no known workaround except to ensure properly formatted requests from all clients.",
