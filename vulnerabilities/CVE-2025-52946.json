  "Description": "A Use After Free vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a BGP update with a specifically malformed AS PATH to cause rpd to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt of the malformed AS PATH attribute will cause a sustained DoS condition.\n\nOn all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, the rpd process will crash and restart when a specifically malformed AS PATH is received within a BGP update and traceoptions are enabled.\n\nThis issue only affects systems with BGP traceoptions enabled and requires a BGP session to be already established.  Systems without BGP traceoptions enabled are not impacted by this issue.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n\u00a0Junos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  all versions of 21.4,\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2;\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 22.4R3-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S4-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a more complete fix for previously published CVE-2024-39549 (JSA83011).",
