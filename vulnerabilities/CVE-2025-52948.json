  "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker, in rare cases, sending specific, unknown traffic patterns to cause the FPC and system to crash and restart.\n\nBPF provides a raw interface to data link layers in a protocol independent fashion. Internally within the Junos kernel, due to a rare timing issue (race condition), when a BPF instance is cloned, the newly created interface causes an internal structure leakage, leading to a system crash. The precise content and timing of the traffic patterns is indeterminate, but has been seen in a lab environment multiple times.\n\nThis issue is more likely to occur when packet capturing is enabled.\u00a0 See required configuration below.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S1, 24.2R2.",
