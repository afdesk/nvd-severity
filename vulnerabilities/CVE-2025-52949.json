  "Description": "An Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent BGP peer sending a specifically malformed BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nOnly systems configured for Ethernet Virtual Private Networking (EVPN) signaling are vulnerable to this issue.\u00a0\n\nThis issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.This issue affects:\n\nJunos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.4R3-S11,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S7,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S4,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S1,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2;\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.2R3-S7-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S7-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S4-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R2-S1-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.4-EVO before 24.4R1-S3-EVO, 24.4R2-EVO.",
