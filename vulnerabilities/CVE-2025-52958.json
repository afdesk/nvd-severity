  "Description": "A Reachable Assertion vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper\u00a0Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent,\u00a0unauthenticated\u00a0attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved devices, when route validation is enabled, a rare condition during BGP initial session establishment can lead to an rpd crash and restart. This occurs specifically when the connection request fails during error-handling scenario.\n\nContinued session establishment failures leads to a sustained DoS condition.\u00a0\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\n\n  *  All versions before 22.2R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2; \n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n  *  All versions before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4 before\u00a022.4R3-S6-EVO,\n  *  from 23.2 before\u00a023.2R2-S3-EVO,\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO.",
