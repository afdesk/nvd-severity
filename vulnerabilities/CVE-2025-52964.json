  "Description": "A Reachable Assertion vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen the device receives a specific BGP UPDATE packet, the rpd crashes and restarts. Continuous receipt of this specific packet will cause a sustained DoS condition.\n\nFor the issue to occur, BGP multipath with \"pause-computation-during-churn\" must be configured on the device, and the attacker must send the paths via a BGP UPDATE from a established BGP peer.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJunos OS: \n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S7, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-EVO.",
