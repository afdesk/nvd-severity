  "Description": "An Improper Resource Shutdown or Release vulnerability in the SIP ALG of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nWhen an MX Series device with an MS-MPC is configured with two or more service sets which are both processing SIP calls, a specific sequence of call events will lead to a crash and restart of the MS-MPC.\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,\n  *  21.4 versions from 21.4R1,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6.\n\n\n\n\nAs the MS-MPC is EoL after Junos OS 22.4, later versions are not affected.\n\nThis issue does not affect MX-SPC3 or SRX Series devices.",
