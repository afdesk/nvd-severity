  "Description": "A session fixation vulnerability in Moodle 3.x through 3.11.18 allows unauthenticated attackers to hijack user sessions via the sesskey parameter.

Successful exploitation results in full account takeover. According to the Moodle Releases page, \"Bug fixes for security issues in 3.11.x ended 11 December 2023.\" NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
