  "Description": "Multiple stored XSS were found on different nodes with unsanitized parameters in OpenMNS Horizon 33.0.8 and versions earlier than 33.1.6 on multiple platforms that allow an attacker to store on database and then inject HTML and/or Javascript on the page. The solution is to upgrade to Horizon 33.1.6, 33.1.7 or Meridian 2024.2.6, 2024.2.7 or newer. Meridian and Horizon installation instructions state that they are intended for installation within an organization's private networks and should not be directly accessible from the Internet.
