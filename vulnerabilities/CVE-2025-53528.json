  "Description": "Cadwyn creates production-ready community-driven modern Stripe-like API versioning in FastAPI. In versions before 5.4.3, the version parameter of the \"/docs\" endpoint is vulnerable to a Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. This XSS would notably allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code on a user's session for any application based on Cadwyn via a one-click attack. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.4.3.",
