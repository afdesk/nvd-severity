  "Description": "Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) before 9.0.0 Patch 46, 10.0.x before 10.0.15, and 10.1.x before 10.1.9 is vulnerable to a denial of service condition due to improper handling of excessive, comma-separated path segments in both the Webmail interface and the Admin Console. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted GET requests that trigger redundant processing and inflated responses. This leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, resulting in denial of service.",
