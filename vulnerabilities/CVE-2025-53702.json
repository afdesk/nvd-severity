An unauthenticated attacker on the same local network might send a crafted request to\u00a0/cgi-bin/action endpoint and render the device completely unresponsive. A manual restart of the device is required.\u00a0\nThe vendor did not respond in any way. Only version 1.1.0.18 was tested, other versions might be vulnerable as well.",
