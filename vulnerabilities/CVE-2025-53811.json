  "Description": "The configuration of Mosh-Pro on macOS, specifically the \"RunAsNode\" fuse enabled, allows a\u00a0local attacker with unprivileged access to execute arbitrary code that inherits Mosh-Pro TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions.\u00a0\nAcquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Mosh-Pro, potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent.\u00a0\n\nThis issue was detected in 1.3.2\u00a0version of Mosh-Pro. Since authors did not respond to messages from CNA, patching status is unknown.",
