  "Description": "The configuration of Nozbe on macOS, specifically the \"RunAsNode\" fuse enabled, allows a\u00a0local attacker with unprivileged access to execute arbitrary code that inherits Nozbe TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions.\u00a0\nAcquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted-permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.\n\nThis issue was fixed in version 2025.11 of Nozbe.",
