Versions of the DRACOON Branding Service prior to 2.10.0 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Improper neutralization of input from administrative users could inject HTML code into the workflow for newly onboarded users. A fix was made available in version 2.10.0 and rolled out to the DRACOON service. DRACOON customers do not need to take action.",
