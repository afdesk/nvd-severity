  "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows with the WebHook trigger all incoming request details are logged including security sensitive data like access and refresh tokens in cookies. Malicious admins with access to the logs can hijack the user sessions within the token expiration time of them triggering the Flow. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.",
