  "Description": "When encrypting sensitive data, weak encryption keys that are fixed or directly generated based on user passwords are used. Attackers can obtain these keys through methods such as reverse engineering, code leaks, or password guessing, thereby decrypting stored or transmitted encrypted data, leading to the leakage of sensitive information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before 2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue.",
