  "Description": "HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend. In versions 11.0.8 and below, the HAX CMS NodeJS application crashes when an authenticated attacker provides an API request lacking required URL parameters. This vulnerability affects the listFiles and saveFiles endpoints. This vulnerability exists because the application does not properly handle exceptions which occur as a result of changes to user-modifiable URL parameters. This is fixed in version 11.0.9.",
