  "Description": "The Thermo Fisher Torrent Suite Django application 5.18.1 has weak default credentials, which are stored as fixtures for the Django ORM API. The ionadmin user account can be used to authenticate to default deployments with the password ionadmin. The user guide recommends changing default credentials; however, a password change policy for default administrative accounts is not enforced. Many deployments may retain default credentials, in which case an attacker is likely to be able to successfully authenticate with administrative privileges.",
