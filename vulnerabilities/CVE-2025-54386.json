  "Description": "Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In versions 2.11.27 and below, 3.0.0 through 3.4.4 and 3.5.0-rc1, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in WASM Traefik\u2019s plugin installation mechanism. By supplying a maliciously crafted ZIP archive containing file paths with ../ sequences, an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system outside of the intended plugin directory. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE), privilege escalation, persistence, or denial of service. This is fixed in versions 2.11.28, 3.4.5 and 3.5.0.",
