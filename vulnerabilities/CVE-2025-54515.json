  "Description": "The Secure Flag passed to Versal\u2122 Adaptive SoC\u2019s Arm\u00ae Trusted Firmware for Cortex\u00ae-A processors (TF-A) for Arm\u2019s Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI) commands were incorrectly set to secure instead of using the processor\u2019s actual security state. This would allow the PSCI requests to appear they were from processors in the secure state instead of the non-secure state.",
