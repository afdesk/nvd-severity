  "Description": "Electron Capture facilitates video playback for screen-sharing and capture. In versions 2.19.1 and below, the elecap app on macOS allows local unprivileged users to bypass macOS TCC privacy protections by enabling ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE. This environment variable allows arbitrary Node.js code to be executed via the -e flag, which runs inside the main Electron context, inheriting any previously granted TCC entitlements (such as access to Documents, Downloads, etc.). This issue is fixed in version 2.20.0.",
