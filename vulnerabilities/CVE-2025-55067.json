  "Description": "The TLS4B ATG system is vulnerable to improper handling of Unix time values that exceed the 2038 epoch rollover. When the system clock reaches January 19, 2038, it resets to December 13, 1901, causing authentication failures and disrupting core system functionalities such as login access, history visibility, and leak detection termination. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate the system time to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition, leading to administrative lockout, operational timer failures, and corrupted log entries.",
