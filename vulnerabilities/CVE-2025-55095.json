  "Description": "The function _ux_host_class_storage_media_mount()\u00a0is responsible for mounting partitions on a USB mass storage device. When it encounters an extended partition entry in the partition table, it recursively calls itself to mount the next logical partition.\n\nThis recursion occurs in _ux_host_class_storage_partition_read(), which parses up to four partition entries. If an extended partition is found (with type UX_HOST_CLASS_STORAGE_PARTITION_EXTENDED\u00a0or EXTENDED_LBA_MAPPED), the code invokes:\n            _ux_host_class_storage_media_mount(storage, sector + _ux_utility_long_get(...));\n\n\nThere is no limit on the recursion depth or tracking of visited sectors. As a result, a malicious or malformed disk image can include cyclic or excessively deep chains of extended partitions, causing the function to recurse until stack overflow occurs.",
