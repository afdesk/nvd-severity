  "Description": "The Control-M/Agent is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution, arbitrary file read and write and similar unauthorized actions when mutual SSL/TLS authentication is not enabled (i.e. in the default configuration).\n\n\nNOTE: The vendor believes that this vulnerability only occurs when documented security best practices are not followed. BMC has always strongly recommended to use security best practices such as configuring SSL/TLS between Control-M Server and Agent.",
