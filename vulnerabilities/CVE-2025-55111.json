  "Description": "Certain files with overly permissive permissions were identified in the out-of-support Control-M/Agent versions 9.0.18 to 9.0.20 and potentially earlier unsupported versions as well as in newer versions which were upgraded from an affected version. These files contain keys and passwords relating to SSL files, keystore and policies. An attacker with local access to the system running the Agent can access these files.",
