  "Description": "A flaw in Node.js\u2019s Permissions model allows attackers to bypass `--allow-fs-read` and `--allow-fs-write` restrictions using crafted relative symlink paths. By chaining directories and symlinks, a script granted access only to the current directory can escape the allowed path and read sensitive files. This breaks the expected isolation guarantees and enables arbitrary file read/write, leading to potential system compromise.\nThis vulnerability affects users of the permission model on Node.js v20,  v22,  v24, and v25.",
