  "Description": "ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to versions 6.9.13-27 and 7.1.2-1, there is undefined behavior (function-type-mismatch) in splay tree cloning callback. This results in a deterministic abort under UBSan (DoS in sanitizer builds), with no crash in a non-sanitized build. This issue has been patched in versions 6.9.13-27 and 7.1.2-1.",
