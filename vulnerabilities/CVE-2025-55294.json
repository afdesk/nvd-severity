  "Description": "screenshot-desktop allows capturing a screenshot of your local machine. This vulnerability is a command injection issue. When user-controlled input is passed into the format option of the screenshot function, it is interpolated into a shell command without sanitization. This results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the calling process. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.15.2.",
