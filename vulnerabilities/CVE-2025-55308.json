  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. A crafted PDF containing JavaScript that calls closeDoc() while internal objects are still in use can cause premature release of these objects. This use-after-free vulnerability may lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in information disclosure when the PDF is opened.",
