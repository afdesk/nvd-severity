  "Description": "Telpo MDM 1.4.6 thru 1.4.9 for Android contains sensitive administrator credentials and MQTT server connection details (IP/port) that are stored in plaintext within log files on the device's external storage. This allows attackers with access to these logs to: 1. Authenticate to the MDM web platform to execute administrative operations (device shutdown/factory reset/software installation); 2. Connect to the MQTT server to intercept/publish device data.",
