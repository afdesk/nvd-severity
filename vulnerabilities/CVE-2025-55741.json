  "Description": "UnoPim is an open-source Product Information Management (PIM) system built on the Laravel framework. In versions 0.3.0 and earlier, users without the Delete privilege for products are unable to delete individual products via the standard endpoint, as expected. However, these users can bypass intended access controls by issuing requests to the mass-delete endpoint, allowing them to delete products without proper authorization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized product deletion, leading to potential data loss and business disruption. The issue is fixed in version 0.3.1. No known workarounds exist.",
