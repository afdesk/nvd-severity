  "Description": "Reolink desktop application 8.18.12 contains a vulnerability in its local authentication mechanism. The application implements lock screen password logic entirely on the client side using JavaScript within an Electron resource file. Because the password is stored and returned via a modifiable JavaScript property(a.settingsManager.lockScreenPassword), an attacker can patch the return value to bypass authentication.",
