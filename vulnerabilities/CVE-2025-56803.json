  "Description": "Figma Desktop for Windows version 125.6.5 contains a command injection vulnerability in the local plugin loader. An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands by setting a crafted build field in the plugin's manifest.json. This field is passed to child_process.exec without validation, leading to possible RCE. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the behavior only allows a local user to attack himself via a local plugin. The local build procedure, which is essential to the attack, is not executed for plugins shared to the Figma Community.",
