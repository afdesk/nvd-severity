  "Description": "A command injection vulnerability in COMFAST CF-XR11 (firmware V2.7.2) exists in the multi_pppoe API, processed by the sub_423930 function in /usr/bin/webmgnt. The phy_interface parameter is not sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands via a POST request to /cgi-bin/mbox-config?method=SET&section=multi_pppoe. When the action parameter is set to \"one_click_redial\", the unsanitized phy_interface is used in a system() call, enabling execution of malicious commands. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, execution of arbitrary code, or full device compromise.",
