  "Description": "The Blackmagic ATEM Mini Pro 2.7 exposes sensitive device and stream configuration information via an unauthenticated Telnet service on port 9990. Upon connection, the attacker can access a protocol preamble that leaks the video mode, routing configuration, input/output labels, device model, and even internal identifiers such as the unique ID. This can be used for reconnaissance and planning further attacks.",
