  "Description": "An issue in H3C Device R365V300R004 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the default password. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that their \"product lines enforce or clearly prompt users to change any initial credentials upon first use. At most, this would be a case of misconfiguration if an administrator deliberately ignored the prompts, which is outside the scope of CVE definitions.\"",
