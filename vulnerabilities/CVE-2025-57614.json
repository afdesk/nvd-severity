  "Description": "An issue was discovered in rust-ffmpeg 0.3.0 (after comit 5ac0527) Integer overflow and invalid input vulnerability in the cached method allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability occurs when dimension parameters are zero or exceed i32::MAX, leading to an unchecked cast that violates the underlying C function's preconditions and triggers undefined behavior.",
