  "Description": "An issue was discovered in rust-ffmpeg 0.3.0 (after comit 5ac0527) An integer overflow vulnerability in the Vector::new constructor function allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a null pointer dereference. The vulnerability stems from an unchecked cast of a usize parameter to c_int, which can result in a negative value being passed to the underlying C function sws_allocVec().",
