  "Description": "Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions before 12.16.0.RELEASE, and from 13.0.0.RELEASE to before 13.1.2.RELEASE, any admin that can create or modify and execute process-definitions could gain access to sensitive data or resources. This includes but is not limited to: running executables on the application host, inspecting and extracting data from the host environment or application properties, spring beans (application context, database pooling). The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: the user must be logged in, have the admin role, and must have some knowledge about running scripts via a the Camunda/Operator engine. Version 12.16.0 and 13.1.2 have been patched. It is strongly advised to upgrade. If no scripting is needed in any of the processes, it could be possible to disable it altogether via the ProcessEngineConfiguration. However, this workaround could lead to unexpected side-effects.",
