  "Description": "WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to version 3.4.11, a remote code execution vulnerability was identified, caused by improper validation of uploaded files. The application allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary filenames, including those with a .php extension. Because the uploaded file is written directly to disk without adequate sanitization or extension restrictions, a spreadsheet file followed by PHP code can be uploaded and executed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is due to insufficient mitigation of CVE-2025-22133. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.11.",
