When configured with output: 'server' while using the default imageService: 'compile', the generated image optimization endpoint doesn't check the URLs it receives, allowing content from unauthorized third-party domains to be served. a A bug in impacted versions of the @astrojs/cloudflare adapter for deployment on Cloudflare\u2019s infrastructure, allows an attacker to bypass the third-party domain restrictions and serve any content from the vulnerable origin.
