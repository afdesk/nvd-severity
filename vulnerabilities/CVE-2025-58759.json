  "Description": "TinyEnv is an environment variable loader for PHP applications. In versions 1.0.9 and 1.0.10, TinyEnv did not properly strip inline comments inside .env values. This could lead to unexpected behavior or misconfiguration, where variables contain unintended characters (including # or comment text). Applications depending on strict environment values may expose logic errors, insecure defaults, or failed authentication. The issue is fixed in v1.0.11. Users should upgrade to the latest patched version. As a temporary workaround, avoid using inline comments in .env files, or sanitize loaded values manually.",
