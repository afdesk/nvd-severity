  "Description": "Backend users with access to the redirects module and write permission on the sys_redirect table were able to read, create, and modify any redirect record without restriction to the user\u2019s own file-mounts or web-mounts. This allowed attackers to insert or alter redirects pointing to arbitrary URLs \u2013 facilitating phishing or other malicious redirect attacks.
