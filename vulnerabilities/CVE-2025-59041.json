  "Description": "Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. At startup, Claude Code executed a command templated in with `git config user.email`. Prior to version 1.0.105, a maliciously configured user email in git could be used to trigger arbitrary code execution before a user accepted the workspace trust dialog. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to version 1.0.105 or the latest version.",
