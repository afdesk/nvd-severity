  "Description": "The npm package `interactive-git-checkout` is an interactive command-line tool that allows users to checkout a git branch while it prompts for the branch name on the command-line. It is available as an npm package and can be installed via `npm install -g interactive-git-checkout`. Versions up to and including 1.1.4 of the `interactive-git-checkout` tool are vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability because the software passes the branch name to the `git checkout` command using the Node.js child process module's `exec()` function without proper input validation or sanitization. Commit 8dd832dd302af287a61611f4f85e157cd1c6bb41 fixes the issue.",
