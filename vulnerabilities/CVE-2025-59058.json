  "Description": "httpsig-rs is a Rust implementation of IETF RFC 9421 http message signatures. Prior to version 0.0.19, the HMAC signature comparison is not timing-safe. This makes anyone who uses HS256 signature verification vulnerable to a timing attack that allows the attacker to forge a signature. Version 0.0.19 fixes the issue.",
