  "Description": "Multiple hardcoded credentials have been identified, which are allowed to sign-in to the exos 9300 datapoint server running on port 1004 and 1005. This server is used for relaying status information from and to the Access Managers. This information, among other things, is used to graphically visualize open doors and alerts. However, controlling the Access Managers via this interface is also possible.\n\nTo send and receive status information, authentication is necessary. The Kaba exos 9300 application contains hard-coded credentials for four different users, which are allowed to login to the datapoint server and receive as well as send information, including commands to open arbitrary doors.",
