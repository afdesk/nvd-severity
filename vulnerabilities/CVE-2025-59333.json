  "Description": "The mcp-database-server (MCP Server) 1.1.0 and earlier, as distributed via the npm package @executeautomation/database-server, fails to implement adequate security controls to properly enforce a \"read-only\" mode. This vulnerability affects only the npm distribution; other distributions are not impacted. As a result, the server is susceptible to abuse and attacks on affected database systems such as PostgreSQL, and potentially others that expose elevated functionalities. These attacks may lead to denial of service and other unexpected behaviors.",
