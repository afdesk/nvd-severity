  "Description": "Luanox is a module host for Lua packages. Prior to 0.1.1, a file traversal vulnerability can cause potential denial of service by overwriting Phoenix runtime files. Package names like ../../package are not properly filtered and pass the validity check of the rockspec verification system. This causes the uploaded file to be stored at the relative path location. If planned carefully, this could overwrite a runtime file and cause the website to crash. This vulnerability is fixed by 0.1.1.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN",
