  "Description": "tar-fs provides filesystem bindings for tar-stream. Versions prior to 3.1.1, 2.1.3, and 1.16.5 are vulnerable to symlink validation bypass if the destination directory is predictable with a specific tarball. This issue has been patched in version 3.1.1, 2.1.4, and 1.16.6. A workaround involves using the ignore option on non files/directories.",
