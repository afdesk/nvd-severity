  "Description": "Apache Druid\u2019s Kerberos authenticator uses a weak fallback secret when the `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret` configuration is not explicitly set. In this case, the secret is generated using `ThreadLocalRandom`,\n which is not a crypto-graphically secure random number generator. This \nmay allow an attacker to predict or brute force the secret used to sign \nauthentication cookies, potentially enabling token forgery or \nauthentication bypass. Additionally, each process generates its own \nfallback secret, resulting in inconsistent secrets across nodes. This \ncauses authentication failures in distributed or multi-broker \ndeployments, effectively leading to a incorrectly configured clusters. Users are \nadvised to configure a strong\u00a0`druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret`\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Druid: through 34.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 35.0.0, which fixes the issue making it mandatory to set `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret` when using the\u00a0Kerberos authenticator. Services will fail to come up if the secret is not set.",
