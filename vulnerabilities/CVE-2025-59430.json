  "Description": "Mesh Connect JS SDK contains JS libraries for integrating with Mesh Connect. Prior to version 3.3.2, the lack of sanitization of URLs protocols in the createLink.openLink function enables the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the parent page. This is technically indistinguishable from a real page at the rendering level and allows access to the parent page DOM, storage, session, and cookies. If the attacker can specify customIframeId, they can hijack the source of existing iframes. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.2.",
