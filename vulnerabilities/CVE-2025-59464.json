  "Description": "A memory leak in Node.js\u2019s OpenSSL integration occurs when converting `X.509` certificate fields to UTF-8 without freeing the allocated buffer. When applications call `socket.getPeerCertificate(true)`, each certificate field leaks memory, allowing remote clients to trigger steady memory growth through repeated TLS connections. Over time this can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.",
