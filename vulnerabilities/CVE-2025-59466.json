  "Description": "We have identified a bug in Node.js error handling where \"Maximum call stack size exceeded\" errors become uncatchable when `async_hooks.createHook()` is enabled. Instead of reaching `process.on('uncaughtException')`, the process terminates, making the crash unrecoverable. Applications that rely on `AsyncLocalStorage` (v22, v20) or `async_hooks.createHook()` (v24, v22, v20) become vulnerable to denial-of-service crashes triggered by deep recursion under specific conditions.",
