  "Description": "Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in TP-Link Archer AX53 v1.0 (tmpserver modules) allows authenticated adjacent attackers to cause a segmentation fault or potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of a packet field whose offset is used to determine the write location in memory. By crafting a packet with a manipulated field offset, an attacker can redirect writes to arbitrary memory locations.This issue affects Archer AX53 v1.0: through 1.3.1 Build 20241120.",
