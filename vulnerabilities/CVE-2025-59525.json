  "Description": "Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). Prior to version 1.4.0, improper sanitization across the application allows XSS via uploaded SVG (and via allowed <embed>), which can be chained to execute JavaScript whenever users view impacted content (e.g., announcements).
