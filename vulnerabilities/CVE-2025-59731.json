  "Description": "When decoding an OpenEXR file that uses DWAA or DWAB compression, the specified raw length of run-length-encoded data is not checked when using it to calculate the output data.\n\nWe read rle_raw_size\u00a0from the input file at [0], we decompress and decode into the buffer td->rle_raw_data\u00a0of size rle_raw_size\u00a0at [1], and then at [2] we will access entries in this buffer up to (td->xsize - 1) * (td->ysize - 1) + rle_raw_size / 2, which may exceed rle_raw_size.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.",
