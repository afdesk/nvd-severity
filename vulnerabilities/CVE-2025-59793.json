  "Description": "Rocket TRUfusion Enterprise through 7.10.5 exposes the endpoint at /axis2/services/WsPortalV6UpDwAxis2Impl to authenticated users to be able to upload files. However, the application doesn't properly sanitize the jobDirectory parameter, which allows path traversal sequences to be included. This allows writing files to arbitrary local filesystem locations and may subsequently lead to remote code execution.",
