  "Description": "Sync Breeze Enterprise Server v10.4.18 and Disk Pulse Enterprise v10.4.18 contain a remote denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the configuration restore functionality. The issue is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data during this process. An attacker could send malicious requests to alter the configuration file, causing the application to become unresponsive. In a successful scenario, the service may not recover on its own and require a complete reinstallation, as the configuration becomes corrupted and prevents the service from restarting, even manually.",
