  "Description": "When hours are entered in time@work, version 7.0.5, it performs a query to display the projects assigned to the user. If the query URL is copied and opened in a new browser window, the \u2018IDClient\u2019 parameter is vulnerable to a blind authenticated SQL injection. If the request is made with the TWAdmin user with the sysadmin role enabled, exploiting the vulnerability will allow commands to be executed on the system; if the user does not belong to the sysadmin role, they will still be able to query data from the database.",
