  "Description": "Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. From versions 2.0.0 to before 2.3.1, the /api/resources endpoint previously allowed POST and DELETE requests without proper authentication or authorization. This could have enabled unauthorized users to create, modify, or delete resources on the platform. The issue has been fixed in FlagForge version 2.3.1.",
