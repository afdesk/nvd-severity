  "Description": "An Untrusted Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nWhen the command 'show route < ( receive-protocol | advertising-protocol ) bgp > detail' is executed, and at least one of the routes in the intended output has specific attributes, this will cause an rpd crash and restart.\n'show route ... extensive' is not affected.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S5,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S5,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S2,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2;\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S5-EVO,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S6-EVO,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S2-EVO,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2-EVO.",
