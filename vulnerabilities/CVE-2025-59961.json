  "Description": "An Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged user to write to the Unix socket used to manage the jdhcpd process, resulting in complete control over the resource.\n\nThis vulnerability allows any low-privileged user logged into the system to connect to the Unix socket and issue commands to manage the DHCP service, in essence, taking administrative control of the local DHCP server or DHCP relay.\n\nThis issue affects:\n Junos OS: \n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S10,\n  *  all versions of 22.2,\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S12,\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S8,\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S5, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S6, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S2, \n  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R2, \n  *  from 25.2 before 25.2R1-S1, 25.2R2; \n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S6-EVO, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S2-EVO, \n  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R2-EVO, \n  *  from 25.2 before 25.2R1-S1-EVO, 25.2R2-EVO.",
