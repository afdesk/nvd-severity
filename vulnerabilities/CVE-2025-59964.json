  "Description": "A Use of Uninitialized Resource vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX4700\u00a0devices allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen forwarding-options sampling\u00a0is enabled, receipt\u00a0of any traffic destined to the Routing Engine (RE) by the PFE line card\u00a0leads to an FPC crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). \n\nContinued receipt and processing of any traffic leading to the RE by the PFE line card will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition to the PFE line card.\n\n\nThis issue affects\u00a0Junos OS on SRX4700:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2\n\n\nThis issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.",
