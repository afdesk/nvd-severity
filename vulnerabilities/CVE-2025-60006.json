  "Description": "Multiple instances of an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') \n\nvulnerability in the CLI of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved could be used to elevate privileges and/or execute unauthorized commands.\n\nWhen an attacker executes crafted CLI commands, the options are processed via a script in some cases. These scripts are not hardened so injected commands might be executed via the shell, which allows an attacker to perform operations, which they should not be able to do according to their assigned permissions.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S2-EVO,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Junos OS Evolved versions earlier than 24.2R1-EVO.",
