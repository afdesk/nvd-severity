  "Description": "A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the chassis daemon (chassisd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX, SRX and EX Series allows a local attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\n\nWhen a user executes the 'show chassis' command with specifically crafted options, chassisd will crash and restart. Due to this all components but the Routing Engine (RE) in the chassis are reinitialized, which leads to a complete service outage, which the system automatically recovers from.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS on MX, SRX and EX Series:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S5,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S6,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S2,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2.",
