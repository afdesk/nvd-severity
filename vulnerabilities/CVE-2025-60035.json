  "Description": "A vulnerability\u00a0has been identified in the OPC.Testclient utility, which is included in Rexroth IndraWorks. All versions prior to 15V24 are affected. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system by parsing a manipulated file containing malicious serialized data. Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically opening a specially crafted file, which then causes the application to deserialize the malicious data, enabling Remote Code Execution (RCE). This can lead to a complete compromise of the system running the OPC.Testclient.",
