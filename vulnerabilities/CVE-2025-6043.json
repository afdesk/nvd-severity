  "Description": "The Malcure Malware Scanner \u2014 #1 Toolset for WordPress Malware Removal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion due to a missing capability check on the wpmr_delete_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 16.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files making remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable when advanced mode is enabled on the site.",
