  "Description": "A local stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the infostat.cgi and cstecgi.cgi binaries of ToToLink routers (A720R V4.1.5cu.614_B20230630, LR1200GB V9.1.0u.6619_B20230130, and NR1800X V9.1.0u.6681_B20230703). Both programs parse the contents of /proc/net/arp using sscanf() with \"%s\" format specifiers into fixed-size stack buffers without length validation. Specifically, one function writes user-controlled data into a single-byte buffer, and the other into adjacent small arrays without bounds checking. An attacker who controls the contents of /proc/net/arp can trigger memory corruption, leading to denial of service or potential arbitrary code execution.",
