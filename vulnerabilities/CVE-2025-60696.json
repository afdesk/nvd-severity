  "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the makeRequest.cgi binary of Linksys RE7000 routers (Firmware FW_v2.0.15_211230_1012). The arplookup function parses lines from /proc/net/arp using sscanf(\"%16s ... %18s ...\"), storing results into buffers v6 (12 bytes) and v7 (20 bytes). Since the format specifiers allow up to 16 and 18 bytes respectively, oversized input can overflow the buffers, resulting in stack corruption. Local attackers controlling /proc/net/arp contents can exploit this issue to cause denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
