  "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TOTOLINK A950RG Router firmware V5.9c.4592_B20191022_ALL within the `global.so` binary. The `getSaveConfig` function retrieves the `http_host` parameter from user input via `websGetVar` and copies it into a fixed-size stack buffer (`v13`) using `strcpy()` without performing any length checks. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the router's web interface, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
