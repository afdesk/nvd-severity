  "Description": "Reolink Video Doorbell WiFi DB_566128M5MP_W allows root shell access through an unsecured UART/serial console. An attacker with physical access can connect to the exposed interface and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because of \"certain restrictions on users privately connecting serial port cables\" and because \"the root user has a password and it meets the requirements of password security complexity.\"",
