  "Description": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in SevenCs ORCA G2 2.0.1.35 (EC2007 Kernel v5.22). The flaw is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the license management logic. The regService process, which runs with SYSTEM privileges, creates a fixed directory and writes files without verifying whether the path is an NTFS reparse point. By exploiting this race condition, an attacker can replace the target directory with a junction pointing to a user-controlled path. This causes the SYSTEM-level process to drop binaries in a location fully controlled by the attacker, allowing arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited by any standard user with only a single UAC confirmation, making it highly practical and dangerous in real-world environments.",
