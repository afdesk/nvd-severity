  "Description": "Deserialization of untrusted data in\u00a0python in pyfory\u00a0versions 0.12.0 through 0.12.2, or the\u00a0legacy\u00a0pyfury versions from\u00a00.1.0 through 0.10.3: allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources.\u00a0An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is\u00a0vulnerable to\u00a0remote code execution.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue.",
