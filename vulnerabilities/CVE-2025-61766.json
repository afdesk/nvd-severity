  "Description": "Bucket is a MediaWiki extension to store and retrieve structured data on articles. Prior to version 1.0.0, infinite recursion can occur if a user queries a bucket using the `!=` comparator. This will result in PHP's call stack limit exceeding, and/or increased memory consumption, potentially leading to a denial of service. Version 1.0.0 contains a patch for the issue.",
