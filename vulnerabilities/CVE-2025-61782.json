Prior to version 6.8.3, an open redirect vulnerability exists in the OpenCTI platform's SAML authentication endpoint (/auth/saml/callback). By manipulating the RelayState parameter, an attacker can force the server to issue a 302 redirect to any external URL, enabling phishing, credential theft, and arbitrary site redirection.
