  "Description": "LLaMA-Factory is a tuning library for large language models. Prior to version 0.9.4, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the chat API allows any authenticated user to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal and external networks. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal services, reconnaissance of the internal network, or interaction with third-party services. The same mechanism also allows for a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, enabling users to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The vulnerability exists in the `_process_request` function within `src/llamafactory/api/chat.py.` This function is responsible for processing incoming multimodal content, including images, videos, and audio provided via URLs. The function checks if the provided URL is a base64 data URI or a local file path (`os.path.isfile`). If neither is true, it falls back to treating the URL as a web URI and makes a direct HTTP GET request using `requests.get(url, stream=True).raw` without any validation or sanitization of the URL. Version 0.9.4 fixes the underlying issue.",
