  "Description": "The bSecure plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within its order_info REST endpoint in versions 1.3.7 through 1.7.9. The plugin registers the /webhook/v2/order_info/ route with a permission_callback that always returns true, effectively bypassing all authentication. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know any user\u2019s email to obtain a valid login cookie and fully impersonate that account.",
