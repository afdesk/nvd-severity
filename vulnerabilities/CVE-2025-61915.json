  "Description": "OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Prior to version 2.4.15, a user in the lpadmin group can use the cups web ui to change the config and insert a malicious line. Then the cupsd process which runs as root will parse the new config and cause an out-of-bound write. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.15.",
