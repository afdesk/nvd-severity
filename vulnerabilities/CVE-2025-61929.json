  "Description": "Cherry Studio is a desktop client that supports for multiple LLM providers. Cherry Studio registers a custom protocol called `cherrystudio://`. When handling the MCP installation URL, it parses the base64-encoded configuration data and directly executes the command within it. In the files `src/main/services/ProtocolClient.ts` and `src/main/services/urlschema/mcp-install.ts`, when receiving a URL of the `cherrystudio://mcp` type, the `handleMcpProtocolUrl` function is called for processing. If an attacker crafts malicious content and posts it on a website or elsewhere (there are many exploitation methods, such as creating a malicious website with a button containing this malicious content), when the user clicks it, since the pop-up window contains normal content, the direct click is considered a scene action, and the malicious command is directly triggered, leading to the user being compromised. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist.",
