  "Description": "BullWall Ransomware Containment supports configurable file and directory exclusions such as '$recycle.bin' to balance monitoring scope and performance. Certain exclusion patterns could allow an authenticated attacker with file-write permissions to rename directories in a way that avoids monitoring. Fixed in 4.6.1.14 and 5.0.0.42, which removes hardcoded exclusion behavior and exposes exclusion handling as configurable settings.",
