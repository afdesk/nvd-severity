An authenticated attacker could encrypt a single (possibly large) file without triggering detection if thresholds are configured to require multiple file changes. The number of files to trigger detection can be configured by the user. Versions 4.6.0.0, 4.6.0.6, 4.6.0.7, and 4.6.1.4 are affected. Other versions may also be affected.",
