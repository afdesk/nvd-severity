  "Description": "The WP Import Export Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'wpie_tempalte_import' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.28. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
