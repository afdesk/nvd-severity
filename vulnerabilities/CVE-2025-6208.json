  "Description": "The `SimpleDirectoryReader` component in `llama_index.core` version 0.12.23 suffers from uncontrolled memory consumption due to a resource management flaw. The vulnerability arises because the user-specified file limit (`num_files_limit`) is applied after all files in a directory are loaded into memory. This can lead to memory exhaustion and degraded performance, particularly in environments with limited resources. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.41.",
