  "Description": "Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 expose artifact repository credentials in plaintext in workflow-controller pod logs. An attacker with permissions to read pod logs in a namespace running Argo Workflows can read the workflow-controller logs and obtain credentials to the artifact repository. Update to versions 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the vulnerability. No known workarounds exist.",
