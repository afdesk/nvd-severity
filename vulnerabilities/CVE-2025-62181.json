  "Description": "Pega Platform versions 7.1.0 through Infinity 25.1.0 are affected by a User Enumeration.  This issue occurs during user authentication process, where a difference in response time could allow a remote unauthenticated user to determine if a username is valid or not.  This only applies to deprecated basic-authentication feature and other more secure authentication mechanisms are recommended.  A fix is being provided in the 24.1.4, 24.2.4, and 25.1.1 patch releases.  Please note:  Basic credentials authentication service type is deprecated started in 24.2 version:  https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/release-notes/security/whats-new-security-242.html.",
