  "Description": "yt-grabber-tui is a terminal user interface application for downloading videos. In versions before 1.0-rc, the application allows users to configure the path to the yt-dlp executable via the path_to_yt_dlp configuration setting. An attacker with write access to the configuration file or the filesystem location of the configured executable can replace the executable with malicious code or create a symlink to an arbitrary executable. When the application invokes yt-dlp, the malicious code is executed with the privileges of the user running yt-grabber-tui. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.0-rc.",
