  "Description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Prior to 25.7.0, there is a reflected-XSS in `report_this` function in `librenms/includes/functions.php`. The `report_this` function had improper filtering (`htmlentities` function was incorrectly use in a href environment), which caused the `project_issues` parameter to trigger an XSS vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.7.0.",
