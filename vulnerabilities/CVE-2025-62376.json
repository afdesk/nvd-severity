  "Description": "pwn.college DOJO is an education platform for learning cybersecurity. Prior to commit 467db0b9ea0d9a929dc89b41f6eb59f7cfc68bef, the /workspace endpoint contains an improper authentication vulnerability that allows an attacker to access any active Windows VM without proper authorization. The vulnerability occurs in the view_desktop function where the user is retrieved via a URL parameter without verifying that the requester has administrative privileges. An attacker can supply any user ID and arbitrary password in the request parameters to impersonate another user. When requesting a Windows desktop service, the function does not validate the supplied password before generating access credentials, allowing the attacker to obtain an iframe source URL that grants full access to the target user's Windows VM. This impacts all users with active Windows VMs, as an attacker can access and modify data on the Windows machine and in the home directory of the associated Linux machine via the Z: drive. This issue has been patched in commit 467db0b9ea0d9a929dc89b41f6eb59f7cfc68bef. No known workarounds exist.",
