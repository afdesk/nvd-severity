  "Description": "MQTTX is an MQTT 5.0 desktop client and MQTT testing tool. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was introduced in MQTTX v1.12.0 due to improper handling of MQTT message payload rendering. Malicious payloads containing HTML or JavaScript could be rendered directly in the MQTTX message viewer. If exploited, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the application UI \u2014 for example, attempting to access MQTT connection credentials or trigger unintended actions through script injection. This vulnerability is especially relevant when MQTTX is used with brokers in untrusted or multi-tenant environments, where message content cannot be fully controlled. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.12.1.",
