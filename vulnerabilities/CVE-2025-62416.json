  "Description": "Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. Bagisto v2.3.7 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) due to unsanitized user input being processed by the server-side templating engine when rendering product descriptions. This allows an attacker with product creation privileges to inject arbitrary template expressions that are evaluated by the backend \u2014 potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.8.",
