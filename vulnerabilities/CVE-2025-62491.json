  "Description": "A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability exists in the QuickJS engine's standard library when iterating over the global list of unhandled rejected promises (ts->rejected_promise_list).\n\n  *  The function js_std_promise_rejection_check attempts to iterate over the rejected_promise_list to report unhandled rejections using a standard list loop.\n\n\n  *  The reason for a promise rejection is processed inside the loop, including calling js_std_dump_error1(ctx, rp->reason).\n\n\n  *  If the promise rejection reason is an Error object that defines a custom property getter (e.g., via Object.defineProperty), this getter is executed during the error dumping process.\n\n\n  *  The malicious custom getter can execute JavaScript code that calls catch() on the same rejected promise being processed.\n\n\n  *  Calling catch() internally triggers js_std_promise_rejection_tracker, which then removes and frees the current promise entry (JSRejectedPromiseEntry) from the rejected_promise_list.\n\n\n  *  Since the list iteration continues using the now-freed memory pointer (el), the subsequent loop access results in a Use-After-Free condition.",
