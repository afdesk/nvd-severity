  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in the QuickJS engine's BigInt string parsing logic (js_bigint_from_string) when attempting to create a BigInt from a string with an excessively large number of digits.\n\nThe function calculates the necessary number of bits (n_bits) required to store the BigInt using the formula:\n\n$$\\text{n\\_bits} = (\\text{n\\_digits} \\times 27 + 7) / 8 \\quad (\\text{for radix 10})$$\n\n  *  For large input strings (e.g., $79,536,432$ digits or more for base 10), the intermediate calculation $(\\text{n\\_digits} \\times 27 + 7)$ exceeds the maximum value of a standard signed 32-bit integer, resulting in an Integer Overflow.\n\n\n  *  The resulting n_bits value becomes unexpectedly small or even negative due to this wrap-around.\n\n\n  *  This flawed n_bits is then used to compute n_limbs, the number of memory \"limbs\" needed for the BigInt object. Since n_bits is too small, the calculated n_limbs is also significantly underestimated.\n\n\n  *  The function proceeds to allocate a JSBigInt object using this underestimated n_limbs.\n\n\n  *  When the function later attempts to write the actual BigInt data into the allocated object, the small buffer size is quickly exceeded, leading to a Heap Out-of-Bounds Write as data is written past the end of the allocated r->tab array.",
