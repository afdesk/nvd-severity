  "Description": "Rollbar.js offers error tracking and logging from Javascript to Rollbar. In versions before 2.26.5 and from 3.0.0-alpha1 to before 3.0.0-beta5, there is a prototype pollution vulnerability in merge(). If application code calls rollbar.configure() with untrusted input, prototype pollution is possible. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.26.5 and 3.0.0-beta5. A workaround involves ensuring that values passed to rollbar.configure() do not contain untrusted input.",
