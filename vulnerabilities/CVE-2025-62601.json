  "Description": "Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group\n). Prior to versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11, when the security mode is enabled, modifying the DATA Submessage within an \nSPDP packet sent by a publisher causes a heap buffer overflow, resulting in remote termination of Fast-DDS. If the fields \nof `PID_IDENTITY_TOKEN` or `PID_PERMISSIONS_TOKEN` in the DATA Submessage \u2014 specifically by tampering with the `str_size` \nvalue read by `readString` (called from `readBinaryProperty`) \u2014 are modified, a 32-bit integer overflow can occur, causing\n `std::vector::resize` to use an attacker-controlled size and quickly trigger heap buffer overflow and remote process term\nination. Versions 3.4.1, 3.3.1, and 2.6.11 patch the issue.",
