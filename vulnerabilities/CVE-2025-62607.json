  "Description": "Nautobot Single Source of Truth (SSoT) is an app for Nautobot. Prior to version 3.10.0, an unauthenticated attacker could access this page to view the Service Now public instance name e.g. companyname.service-now.com. This is considered low-value information. This does not expose the Secret, the Secret Name, or the Secret Value for the Username/Password for Service-Now.com. An unauthenticated member would not be able to change the instance name, nor set a Secret. There is not a way to gain access to other pages Nautobot through the unauthenticated Configuration page. This issue has been patched in version 3.10.0.",
