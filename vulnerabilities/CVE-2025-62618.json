  "Description": "ELOG allows an authenticated user to upload arbitrary HTML files. The HTML content is executed in the context of other users when they open the file. Because ELOG includes usernames and password hashes in certain HTTP requests, an attacker can obtain the target's credentials and replay them or crack the password hash offline. In ELOG 3.1.5-20251014 release, HTML files are rendered as plain text.",
