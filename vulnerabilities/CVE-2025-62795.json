  "Description": "JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system. Prior to v3.10.21-lts and v4.10.12-lts, a low-privileged authenticated user can invoke LDAP configuration tests and start LDAP synchronization by sending crafted messages to the /ws/ldap/ WebSocket endpoint, bypassing authorization checks and potentially exposing LDAP credentials or causing unintended sync operations. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.21-lts and v4.10.12-lts.",
