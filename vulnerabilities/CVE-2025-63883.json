  "Description": "A DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in electic-shop v1.0 (Bhabishya-123/E-commerce). The site's client-side JavaScript reads attacker-controlled input (for example, values derived from the URL or page fragment) and inserts it into the DOM via unsafe sinks (innerHTML/insertAdjacentHTML/document.write) without proper sanitization or context-aware encoding. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when opened by a victim, causes arbitrary JavaScript to execute in the victim's browser under the electic-shop origin.",
