  "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the GnuTLS software in _gnutls_figure_common_ciphersuite(). When it reads certain settings from a template file, it can allow an attacker to cause an out-of-bounds (OOB) NULL pointer write, resulting in memory corruption and a denial of service (DoS) that could crash the system.",
