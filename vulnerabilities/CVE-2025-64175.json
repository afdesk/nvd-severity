  "Description": "Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. In version 0.13.3 and prior, Gogs\u2019 2FA recovery code validation does not scope codes by user, enabling cross-account bypass. If an attacker knows a victim\u2019s username and password, they can use any unused recovery code (e.g., from their own account) to bypass the victim\u2019s 2FA. This enables full account takeover and renders 2FA ineffective in all environments where it's enabled.. This issue has been patched in versions 0.13.4 and 0.14.0+dev.",
