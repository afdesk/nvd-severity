  "Description": "ThinkDashboard is a self-hosted bookmark dashboard built with Go and vanilla JavaScript. In versions 0.6.7 and below, an attacker can upload any file they wish to the /data directory of the web application via the backup import feature. When importing a backup, an attacker can first choose a .zip file to bypass the client-side file-type verification. This could lead to stored XSS, or be used for other nefarious purposes such as malware distribution. This issue is fixed in version 0.6.8.",
