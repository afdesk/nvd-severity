  "Description": "ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. In versions 5.5.2-#146 and below, the Manage Playlists feature is vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS),specifically in the Playlist Name field. An authenticated low-privileged user can create a playlist with a malicious name containing HTML/JavaScript code, which is rendered unescaped on playlist detail and listing pages. This results in arbitrary JavaScript execution in every viewer\u2019s browser, including administrators. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.2-#147.",
