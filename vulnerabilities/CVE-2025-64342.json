  "Description": "ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. When the ESP32 is in advertising mode, if it receives a connection request containing an invalid Access Address (AA) of 0x00000000 or 0xFFFFFFFF, advertising may stop unexpectedly. In this case, the controller may incorrectly report a connection event to the host, which can cause the application layer to assume that the device has successfully established a connection. This issue has been fixed in versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.5, 5.2.6, and 5.1.7. At time of publication versions 5.5.2, 5.3.5, and 5.1.7 have not been released but are fixed respectively in commits 3b95b50, e3d7042, and 75967b5.",
