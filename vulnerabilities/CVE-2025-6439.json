  "Description": "The WooCommerce Designer Pro plugin for WordPress, used by the Pricom - Printing Company & Design Services WordPress theme, is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'wcdp_save_canvas_design_ajax' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.26. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete all files in an arbitrary directory on the server, which can lead to remote code execution, data loss, or site unavailability.",
