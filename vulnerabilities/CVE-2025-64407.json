  "Description": "Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links. A missing Authorization vulnerability in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links \nto be loaded without prompt. Such links could also be used to transmit system information, such as environment variables or configuration settings.\n\nIn the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, documents that used a certain URI scheme linking to external files would \nload the contents of such files without prompting the user for \npermission to do so. Such URI scheme allows to include system configuration data, that is not supposed to be transmitted externally.\n\nThis issue affects Apache OpenOffice: through 4.1.15.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.16, which fixes the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LibreOffice suite reported this issue as\u00a0CVE-2024-12426.",
