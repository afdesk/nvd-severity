  "Description": "Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. Versions 4.0.0-rc.1 through 4.6.2 are vulnerable to secure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) attacks through its V2Beta API, allowing authenticated users with specific administrator roles within one organization to access and modify data belonging to other organizations. Note that this vulnerability is limited to organization-level data (name, domains, metadata). No other related data (such as users, projects, applications, etc.) is affected. This issue is fixed in version 4.6.3.",
