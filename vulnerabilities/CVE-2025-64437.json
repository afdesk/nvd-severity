  "Description": "KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In versions before 1.5.3 and 1.6.1, the virt-handler does not verify whether the launcher-sock is a symlink or a regular file. This oversight can be exploited, for example, to change the ownership of arbitrary files on the host node to the unprivileged user with UID 107 (the same user used by virt-launcher) thus, compromising the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) of data on the host. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker should be in control of the file system of the virt-launcher pod. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.3 and 1.6.1.",
