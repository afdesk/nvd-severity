  "Description": "Wazuh is a security detection, visibility, and compliance open source project. From version 4.9.0 to before 4.13.0, the Wazuh API \u2013 Agent Configuration in certain configurations allows authenticated users with read-only API roles to retrieve agent enrollment credentials through the /utils/configuration endpoint. These credentials can be used to register new agents within the same Wazuh tenant without requiring elevated permissions through the UI. This issue has been patched in version 4.13.0.",
