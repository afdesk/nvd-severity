  "Description": "SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. Versions 7.14.7 and below allow unauthenticated reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation could lead to full account takeover, for example by altering the login form to send credentials to an attacker-controlled server. As a reflected XSS issue, exploitation requires the victim to open a crafted malicious link, which can be delivered via phishing, social media, or other communication channels. This issue is fixed in version 7.14.8.",
