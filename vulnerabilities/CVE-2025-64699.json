  "Description": "An incorrect NULL DACL issue exists in SevenCs ORCA G2 2.0.1.35 (EC2007 Kernel v5.22). The regService process, which runs with SYSTEM privileges, applies a Security Descriptor to a device object with no explicitly configured DACL. This condition could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized raw disk operations, which could lead to system disruption (DoS) and exposure of sensitive data, and may facilitate local privilege escalation.",
