  "Description": "quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Versions 0.56.0 and below are vulnerable to excessive memory allocation through quic-go's HTTP/3 client and server implementations by sending a QPACK-encoded HEADERS frame that decodes into a large header field section (many unique header names and/or large values). The implementation builds an http.Header (used on the http.Request and http.Response, respectively), while only enforcing limits on the size of the (QPACK-compressed) HEADERS frame, but not on the decoded header, leading to memory exhaustion. This issue is fixed in version 0.57.0.",
