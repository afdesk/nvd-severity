  "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 11.13.0 that allows users with `upload files` and `edit item` permissions to inject malicious JavaScript through the Block Editor interface. Attackers can bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions by combining file uploads with iframe srcdoc attributes, resulting in persistent XSS execution. Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue.",
