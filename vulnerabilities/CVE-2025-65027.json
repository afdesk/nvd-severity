  "Description": "RomM (ROM Manager) allows users to scan, enrich, browse and play their game collections with a clean and responsive interface. RomM contains multiple unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities that allow authenticated users to upload malicious SVG or HTML files. When these files are accessed the browser executes embedded JavaScript, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) which when combined with a CSRF misconfiguration they lead to achieve full administrative account takeover, creating a rogue admin account, escalating the attacker account role to admin, and much more. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.4.1 and 4.4.1-beta.2.",
