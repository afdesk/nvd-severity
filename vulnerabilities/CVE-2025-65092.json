  "Description": "ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In versions 5.5.1, 5.4.3, and 5.3.4, when the ESP32-P4 uses its hardware JPEG decoder, the software parser lacks necessary validation checks. A specially crafted (malicious) JPEG image could exploit the parsing routine and trigger an out-of-bounds array access. This issue has been fixed in versions 5.5.2, 5.4.4, and 5.3.5. At time of publication versions 5.5.2, 5.4.4, and 5.3.5 have not been released but are fixed respectively in commits 4b8f585, c79cb4d, and 34e2726.",
