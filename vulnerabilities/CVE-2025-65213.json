  "Description": "MooreThreads torch_musa through all versions contains an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in torch_musa.utils.compare_tool. The compare_for_single_op() and nan_inf_track_for_single_op() functions use pickle.load() on user-controlled file paths without validation, allowing arbitrary code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious pickle file that executes arbitrary Python code when loaded, enabling remote code execution with the privileges of the victim process.",
