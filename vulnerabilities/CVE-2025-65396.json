  "Description": "A vulnerability in the boot process of Blurams Flare Camera version 24.1114.151.929 and earlier allows a physically proximate attacker to hijack the boot mechanism and gain a bootloader shell via the UART interface. This is achieved by inducing a read error from the SPI flash memory during the boot, by shorting a data pin of the IC to ground. An attacker can then dump the entire firmware, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information including cryptographic keys and user configurations.",
