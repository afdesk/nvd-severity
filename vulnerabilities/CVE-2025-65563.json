  "Description": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (component upf-epc/pfcpiface) up to at least version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. When the UPF receives a PFCP Association Setup Request that is missing the mandatory NodeID Information Element, the association setup handler dereferences a nil pointer instead of validating the message, causing a panic and terminating the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Association Setup Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services.",
