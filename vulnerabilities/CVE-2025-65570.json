  "Description": "A type confusion in jsish 2.0 allows incorrect control flow during execution of the OP_NEXT opcode. When an \u201cinstanceof\u201d expression uses an array element access as the left-hand operand inside a for-in loop, the instructions implementation leaves an additional array reference on the stack rather than consuming it during OP_INSTANCEOF. As a result, OP_NEXT interprets the array as an iterator object and reads the iterCmd function pointer from an invalid structure, potentially causing a crash or enabling code execution depending on heap layout.",
