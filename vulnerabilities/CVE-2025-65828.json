  "Description": "An unauthenticated attacker within proximity of the Meatmeet device can issue several commands over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to these devices which would result in a Denial of Service. These commands include: shutdown, restart, clear config. Clear config would disassociate the current device from its user and would require re-configuration to re-enable the device. As a result, the end user would be unable to receive updates from the Meatmeet base station which communicates with the cloud services until the device had been fixed or turned back on.",
