  "Description": "The Cordova plugin cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing (SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin) for Android 6.0.4, registers an exported broadcast receiver nl.xservices.plugins.ShareChooserPendingIntent with an android.intent.action.SEND intent filter. The onReceive implementation accesses Intent.EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT without checking for null. If a broadcast is sent with extras present but without EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT, the code dereferences a null value and throws a NullPointerException. Because the receiver is exported and performs no permission or caller validation, any local application on the device can send crafted ACTION_SEND broadcasts to this component and repeatedly crash the host application, resulting in a local, unauthenticated application-level denial of service for any app that includes the plugin.",
