  "Description": "EverShop 2.0.1 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files and create directories via the /api/images endpoint. The endpoint is accessible without authentication by default, and server-side validation of uploaded files is insufficient. This can be abused to upload arbitrary content (including non-image files) which could impersonate user/admin login panels (exfiltrating credentials) and to perform a denial-of-service attack by exhausting disk space.",
