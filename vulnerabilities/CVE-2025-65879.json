The /goods/deleteGoods endpoint accepts a user-controlled goodsimg parameter, which is directly concatenated with the server's UPLOAD_PATH and passed to File.delete() without validation. A remote authenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server by supplying directory traversal payloads.",
