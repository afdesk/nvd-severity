  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Zeroheight (SaaS) prior to 2025-06-13. A legacy user creation API pathway allowed accounts to be created without completing the intended email verification step. While unverified accounts could not access product functionality, the behavior bypassed intended verification controls and allowed unintended account creation. This could have enabled spam/fake account creation or resource usage impact. No data exposure or unauthorized access to existing accounts was reported.",
