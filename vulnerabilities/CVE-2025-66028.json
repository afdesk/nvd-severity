  "Description": "OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. Prior to version 8.0.5567, OneUptime is vulnerable to privilege escalation via Login Response Manipulation. During the login process, the server response included a parameter called isMasterAdmin. By intercepting and modifying this parameter value from false to true, it is possible to gain access to the admin dashboard interface. However, an attacker may be unable to view or interact with the data if they still do not have sufficient permissions. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.5567.",
