  "Description": "Vivotek\u00a0IP7137\u00a0camera with firmware version\u00a00200a is vulnerable to an information disclosure issue where live camera footage can be accessed through the RTSP protocol on port 8554 without requiring authentication. This allows unauthorized users with network access to view the camera's feed, potentially compromising user privacy and security.\u00a0\nThe vendor has not replied to the CNA. Possibly all firmware versions are affected.\u00a0Since the product has met End-Of-Life phase, a fix is not expected to be released.",
