  "Description": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.451, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the File Storage Directory Mount Path functionality allows users with application/service management permissions to execute arbitrary commands as root on managed servers. The file_storage_directory_source parameter is passed directly to shell commands without proper sanitization, enabling full remote code execution on the host system. Version 4.0.0-beta.451 fixes the issue.",
