  "Description": "Ladybug adds message-based debugging, unit, system, and regression testing to Java applications. Versions prior to 3.0-20251107.114628 contain the APIs /iaf/ladybug/api/report/{storage} and /iaf/ladybug/api/report/upload, which allow uploading gzip-compressed XML files with user-controllable content. The system deserializes these XML files, enabling attackers to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by submitting carefully crafted XML payloads and thereby gain access to the target server. This issue is fixed in version 3.0-20251107.114628.",
