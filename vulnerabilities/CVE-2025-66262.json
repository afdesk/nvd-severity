  "Description": "Arbitrary File Overwrite via Tar Extraction Path Traversal in DB Electronica Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. Mozart FM Transmitter versions 30, 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 3500, 6000, 7000 allows an attacker to perform Tar extraction with -C / allow arbitrary file overwrite via crafted archive.\nThe `restore_mozzi_memories.sh` script extracts user-controlled tar archives with `-C /` flag, depositing contents to the filesystem root without path validation. When combined with the unauthenticated file upload vulnerabilities (CVE-01, CVE-06, CVE-07), attackers can craft malicious .tgz archives containing path-traversed filenames (e.g., `etc/shadow`, `var/www/index.php`) to overwrite critical system files in writable directories, achieving full system compromise.",
