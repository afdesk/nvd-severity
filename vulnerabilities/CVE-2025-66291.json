  "Description": "OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0 to 5.7, the interview attachment retrieval endpoint in the Recruitment module serves files based solely on an authenticated session and user-supplied identifiers, without verifying whether the requester has permission to access the associated interview record. Because the server does not perform any recruitment-level authorization checks, an ESS-level user with no access to recruitment workflows can directly request interview attachment URLs and receive the corresponding files. This exposes confidential interview documents\u2014including candidate CVs, evaluations, and supporting files\u2014to unauthorized users. The issue arises from relying on predictable object identifiers and session presence rather than validating the user\u2019s association with the relevant recruitment process. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.",
