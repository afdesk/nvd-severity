Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, due to improper authorization checks when modifying critical fields on a POST request to /admin/pages/{page_name}, an editor with only permissions to change basic content on the form is now able to change the functioning of the form through modifying the content of the data[_json][header][form] which is the YAML frontmatter which includes the process section which dictates what happens after a user submits the form which include some important actions that could lead to further vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.",
