  "Description": "Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, there is an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability in the Grav CMS Admin Panel which allows low-privilege users to access sensitive information from other accounts. Although direct account takeover is not possible, admin email addresses and other metadata can be exposed, increasing the risk of phishing, credential stuffing, and social engineering. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.",
