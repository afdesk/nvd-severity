Prior to 1.11.0-beta.1, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the /admin/config/site endpoint of the Grav application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the data[taxonomies] parameter. The injected payload is stored on the server and automatically executed in the browser of any user who accesses the affected site configuration, resulting in a persistent attack vector. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.0-beta.1.",
