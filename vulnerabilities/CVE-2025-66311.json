  "Description": "This admin plugin for Grav is an HTML user interface that provides a convenient way to configure Grav and easily create and modify pages. Prior to 1.11.0-beta.1, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the /admin/pages/[page] endpoint of the Grav application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the data[header][metadata], data[header][taxonomy][category], and data[header][taxonomy][tag] parameters. These scripts are stored in the page frontmatter and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed or rendered in the administrative interface. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.0-beta.1.",
