  "Description": "FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and batch operations. Prior to 2.2.3, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Filerise application due to improper handling of uploaded SVG files. The application accepts user-supplied SVG uploads without sanitizing or restricting embedded script content. When a malicious SVG containing inline JavaScript or event-based payloads is uploaded, it is later rendered directly in the browser whenever viewed within the application. Because SVGs are XML-based and allow scripting, they execute in the origin context of the application, enabling full stored XSS. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.3.",
