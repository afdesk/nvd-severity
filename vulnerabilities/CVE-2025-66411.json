  "Description": "Coder allows organizations to provision remote development environments via Terraform. Prior to 2.26.5, 2.27.7, and 2.28.4, Workspace Agent manifests containing sensitive values were logged in plaintext unsanitized. An attacker with limited local access to the Coder Workspace (VM, K8s Pod etc.) or a third-party system (SIEM, logging stack) could access those logs. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.26.5, 2.27.7, and 2.28.4.",
