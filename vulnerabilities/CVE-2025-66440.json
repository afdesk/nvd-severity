  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Frappe ERPNext through 15.89.0. Function get_outstanding_reference_documents() at erpnext/accounts/doctype/payment_entry/payment_entry.py is vulnerable to SQL Injection. It allows an attacker to extract arbitrary data from the database by injecting SQL payloads via the to_posting_date parameter, which is directly interpolated into the query without proper sanitization or parameter binding.",
