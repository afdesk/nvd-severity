  "Description": "LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. In versions 0.8.0 and below, when a user posts a question, the iconURL parameter of the POST request can be modified by an attacker. The malicious code is then stored in the chat which can then be shared to other users. When sharing chats with a potentially malicious \u201ctracker\u201d, resources loaded can lead to loss of privacy for users who view the chat link that is sent to them. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.1.",
