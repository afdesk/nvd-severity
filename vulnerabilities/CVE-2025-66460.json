  "Description": "Lookyloo is a web interface that allows users to capture a website page and then display a tree of domains that call each other. Prior to 1.35.3, Lookyloo passed improperly escaped values to cells rendered in datatables using the orthogonal-data feature. It is definitely exploitable from the popup view, but it is most probably also exploitable in many other places. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.3.",
