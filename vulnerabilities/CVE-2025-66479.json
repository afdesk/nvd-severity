  "Description": "Anthropic Sandbox Runtime is a lightweight sandboxing tool for enforcing filesystem and network restrictions on arbitrary processes at the OS level, without requiring a container. Prior to 0.0.16, due to a bug in sandboxing logic, sandbox-runtime did not properly enforce a network sandbox if the sandbox policy did not configure any allowed domains. This could allow sandboxed code to make network requests outside of the sandbox. A patch for this was released in v0.0.16.",
