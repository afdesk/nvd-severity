  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Free5gc NRF 1.4.0. In the access-token generation logic of free5GC, the AccessTokenScopeCheck() function in file internal/sbi/processor/access_token.go bypasses all scope validation when the attacker uses a crafted targetNF value. This allows attackers to obtain an access token with any arbitrary scope.",
