  "Description": "WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. Versions 3.5.4 and below contain a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the /WeGIA/html/geral/configurar_senhas.php endpoint. The application does not sanitize user-controlled data before rendering it inside the employee selection dropdown. The application retrieves employee names from the database and injects them directly into HTML <option> elements without proper escaping. This issue is fixed in version 3.5.5.",
