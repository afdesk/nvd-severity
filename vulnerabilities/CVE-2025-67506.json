  "Description": "PipesHub is a fully extensible workplace AI platform for enterprise search and workflow automation. Versions prior to 0.1.0-beta expose POST /api/v1/record/buffer/convert through missing authentication. The endpoint accepts a file upload and converts it to PDF via LibreOffice by uploading payload to os.path.join(tmpdir, file.filename) without normalizing the filename. An attacker can submit a crafted filename containing ../ sequences to write arbitrary files anywhere the service account has permission, enabling remote file overwrite or planting malicious code. This issue is fixed in version 0.1.0-beta.",
