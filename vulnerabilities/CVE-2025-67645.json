  "Description": "OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. Versions prior to 7.0.4 have a broken access control in the Profile Edit endpoint. An authenticated normal user can modify the request parameters (pubpid / pid) to reference another user\u2019s record; the server accepts the modified IDs and applies the changes to that other user\u2019s profile. This allows one user to alter another user\u2019s profile data (name, contact info, etc.), and could enable account takeover. Version 7.0.4 fixes the issue.",
