  "Description": "ArcGIS Server version 11.5 and earlier on Windows and Linux does not properly validate uploaded files, which allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files. However, exploitation is constrained by server-side controls that prevent execution of uploaded content and do not allow modification of existing application files or system configurations. As a result, successful exploitation would have a low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and would not enable service disruption, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
