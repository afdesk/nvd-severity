  "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that runs Node.js. In versions prior to 8.6.0-alpha.2, a GitHub CI workflow is triggered in a way that grants the GitHub Actions workflow elevated permissions, giving it access to GitHub secrets and write permissions which are defined in the workflow. Code from a fork or lifecycle scripts is potentially included. Only the repository's CI/CD infrastructure is affected, including any public GitHub forks with GitHub Actions enabled. This issue is fixed version 8.6.0-alpha.2 and commits 6b9f896 and e3d27fe.",
