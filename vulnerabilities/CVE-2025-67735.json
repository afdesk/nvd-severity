  "Description": "Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final, the `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestEncoder` has a CRLF injection with the request URI when constructing a request. This leads to request smuggling when `HttpRequestEncoder` is used without proper sanitization of the URI. Any application / framework using `HttpRequestEncoder` can be subject to be abused to perform request smuggling using CRLF injection. Versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final fix the issue.",
