  "Description": "AzuraCast is a self-hosted, all-in-one web radio management suite. Versions 0.23.1 mistakenly include an API endpoint that is intended for internal use by the SFTP software sftpgo, exposing it to the public-facing HTTP API for AzuraCast installations. A user with specific internal knowledge of a station's operations can craft a custom HTTP request that would affect the contents of a station's database, without revealing any internal information about the station. In order to carry out an attack, a malicious user would need to know a valid SFTP station username and the coordinating internal filesystem structure. This issue is fixed in version 0.23.2.",
