  "Description": "Lightning Flow Scanner provides a A CLI plugin, VS Code Extension and GitHub Action for analysis and optimization of Salesforce Flows. Versions 6.10.5 and below allow a maliciously crafted flow metadata file to cause arbitrary JavaScript execution during scanning. The APIVersion rule uses new Function() to evaluate expression strings, enabling an attacker to supply a malicious expression within rule configuration or crafted flow metadata. This could compromise developer machines, CI runners, or editor environments. This issue is fixed in version 6.10.6.",
