  "Description": "ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Versions prior to 6.5.3 have a SQL injection vulnerability in the `src/CartToFamily.php` file, specifically in how the `PersonAddress` POST parameter is handled. Unlike other parameters in the same file which are correctly cast to integers using the `InputUtils` class, the `PersonAddress` parameter is missing the type definition. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands directly into the query. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.",
