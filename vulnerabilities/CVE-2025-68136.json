  "Description": "EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, once the module receives a SDP request, it creates a whole new set of objects like `Session`, `IConnection` which open new TCP socket for the ISO15118-20 communications and registers callbacks for the created file descriptor, without closing and destroying the previous ones. Previous `Session` is not saved and the usage of an `unique_ptr` is lost, destroying connection data. Latter, if the used socket and therefore file descriptor is not the last one, it will lead to a null pointer dereference. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.",
