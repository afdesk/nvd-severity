  "Description": "In mcp-server-git versions prior to 2025.12.17, the git_diff and git_checkout functions passed user-controlled arguments directly to git CLI commands without sanitization. Flag-like values (e.g., `--output=/path/to/file` for `git_diff`) would be interpreted as command-line options rather than git refs, enabling arbitrary file overwrites. The fix adds validation that rejects arguments starting with - and verifies the argument resolves to a valid git ref via rev_parse before execution. Users are advised to update to 2025.12.17 resolve this issue when it is released.",
