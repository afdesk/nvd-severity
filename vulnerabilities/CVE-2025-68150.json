  "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 8.6.2 and 9.1.1-alpha.1, the Instagram authentication adapter allows clients to specify a custom API URL via the `apiURL` parameter in `authData`. This enables SSRF attacks and possibly authentication bypass if malicious endpoints return fake responses to validate unauthorized users. This is fixed in versions 8.6.2 and 9.1.1-alpha.1 by hardcoding the Instagram Graph API URL `https://graph.instagram.com` and ignoring client-provided `apiURL` values. No known workarounds are available.",
