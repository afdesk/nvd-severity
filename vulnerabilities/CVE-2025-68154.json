  "Description": "systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In versions prior to 5.27.14, the `fsSize()` function in systeminformation is vulnerable to OS command injection on Windows systems. The optional `drive` parameter is directly concatenated into a PowerShell command without sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution when user-controlled input reaches this function. The actual exploitability depends on how applications use this function. If an application does not pass user-controlled input to `fsSize()`, it is not vulnerable. Version 5.27.14 contains a patch.",
