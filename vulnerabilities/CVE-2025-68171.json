  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure XFD state on signal delivery\n\nSean reported [1] the following splat when running KVM tests:\n\n   WARNING: CPU: 232 PID: 15391 at xfd_validate_state+0x65/0x70\n   Call Trace:\n    <TASK>\n    fpu__clear_user_states+0x9c/0x100\n    arch_do_signal_or_restart+0x142/0x210\n    exit_to_user_mode_loop+0x55/0x100\n    do_syscall_64+0x205/0x2c0\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nChao further identified [2] a reproducible scenario involving signal\ndelivery: a non-AMX task is preempted by an AMX-enabled task which\nmodifies the XFD MSR.\n\nWhen the non-AMX task resumes and reloads XSTATE with init values,\na warning is triggered due to a mismatch between fpstate::xfd and the\nCPU's current XFD state. fpu__clear_user_states() does not currently\nre-synchronize the XFD state after such preemption.\n\nInvoke xfd_update_state() which detects and corrects the mismatch if\nthere is a dynamic feature.\n\nThis also benefits the sigreturn path, as fpu__restore_sig() may call\nfpu__clear_user_states() when the sigframe is inaccessible.\n\n[ dhansen: minor changelog munging ]",
