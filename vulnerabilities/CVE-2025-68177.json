  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncpufreq/longhaul: handle NULL policy in longhaul_exit\n\nlonghaul_exit() was calling cpufreq_cpu_get(0) without checking\nfor a NULL policy pointer. On some systems, this could lead to a\nNULL dereference and a kernel warning or panic.\n\nThis patch adds a check using unlikely() and returns early if the\npolicy is NULL.\n\nBugzilla: #219962",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN",
  "Score": 0.0
