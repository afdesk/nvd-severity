  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu/atom: Check kcalloc() for WS buffer in amdgpu_atom_execute_table_locked()\n\nkcalloc() may fail. When WS is non-zero and allocation fails, ectx.ws\nremains NULL while ectx.ws_size is set, leading to a potential NULL\npointer dereference in atom_get_src_int() when accessing WS entries.\n\nReturn -ENOMEM on allocation failure to avoid the NULL dereference.",
