  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudp_tunnel: use netdev_warn() instead of netdev_WARN()\n\nnetdev_WARN() uses WARN/WARN_ON to print a backtrace along with\nfile and line information. In this case, udp_tunnel_nic_register()\nreturning an error is just a failed operation, not a kernel bug.\n\nudp_tunnel_nic_register() can fail due to a memory allocation\nfailure (kzalloc() or udp_tunnel_nic_alloc()).\nThis is a normal runtime error and not a kernel bug.\n\nReplace netdev_WARN() with netdev_warn() accordingly.",
