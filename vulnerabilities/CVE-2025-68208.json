  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: account for current allocated stack depth in widen_imprecise_scalars()\n\nThe usage pattern for widen_imprecise_scalars() looks as follows:\n\n    prev_st = find_prev_entry(env, ...);\n    queued_st = push_stack(...);\n    widen_imprecise_scalars(env, prev_st, queued_st);\n\nWhere prev_st is an ancestor of the queued_st in the explored states\ntree. This ancestor is not guaranteed to have same allocated stack\ndepth as queued_st. E.g. in the following case:\n\n    def main():\n      for i in 1..2:\n        foo(i)        // same callsite, differnt param\n\n    def foo(i):\n      if i == 1:\n        use 128 bytes of stack\n      iterator based loop\n\nHere, for a second 'foo' call prev_st->allocated_stack is 128,\nwhile queued_st->allocated_stack is much smaller.\nwiden_imprecise_scalars() needs to take this into account and avoid\naccessing bpf_verifier_state->frame[*]->stack out of bounds.",
