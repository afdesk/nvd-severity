  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: Fix uninitialized 'offp' in statmount_string()\n\nIn statmount_string(), most flags assign an output offset pointer (offp)\nwhich is later updated with the string offset. However, the\nSTATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the\nstruct fields instead of using offp. This leaves offp uninitialized,\nleading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.\n\nFix it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code\npath consistent.",
