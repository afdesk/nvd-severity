  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: pegasus-notetaker - fix potential out-of-bounds access\n\nIn the pegasus_notetaker driver, the pegasus_probe() function allocates\nthe URB transfer buffer using the wMaxPacketSize value from\nthe endpoint descriptor. An attacker can use a malicious USB descriptor\nto force the allocation of a very small buffer.\n\nSubsequently, if the device sends an interrupt packet with a specific\npattern (e.g., where the first byte is 0x80 or 0x42),\nthe pegasus_parse_packet() function parses the packet without checking\nthe allocated buffer size. This leads to an out-of-bounds memory access.",
