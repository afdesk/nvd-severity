  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-multipath: fix lockdep WARN due to partition scan work\n\nBlktests test cases nvme/014, 057 and 058 fail occasionally due to a\nlockdep WARN. As reported in the Closes tag URL, the WARN indicates that\na deadlock can happen due to the dependency among disk->open_mutex,\nkblockd workqueue completion and partition_scan_work completion.\n\nTo avoid the lockdep WARN and the potential deadlock, cut the dependency\nby running the partition_scan_work not by kblockd workqueue but by\nnvme_wq.",
