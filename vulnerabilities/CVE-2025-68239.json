  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinfmt_misc: restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()\n\nbm_register_write() opens an executable file using open_exec(), which\ninternally calls do_open_execat() and denies write access on the file to\navoid modification while it is being executed.\n\nHowever, when an error occurs, bm_register_write() closes the file using\nfilp_close() directly. This does not restore the write permission, which\nmay cause subsequent write operations on the same file to fail.\n\nFix this by calling exe_file_allow_write_access() before filp_close() to\nrestore the write permission properly.",
