  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: avoid having an active sc_timer before freeing sci\n\nBecause kthread_stop did not stop sc_task properly and returned -EINTR,\nthe sc_timer was not properly closed, ultimately causing the problem [1]\nreported by syzbot when freeing sci due to the sc_timer not being closed.\n\nBecause the thread sc_task main function nilfs_segctor_thread() returns 0\nwhen it succeeds, when the return value of kthread_stop() is not 0 in\nnilfs_segctor_destroy(), we believe that it has not properly closed\nsc_timer.\n\nWe use timer_shutdown_sync() to sync wait for sc_timer to shutdown, and\nset the value of sc_task to NULL under the protection of lock\nsc_state_lock, so as to avoid the issue caused by sc_timer not being\nproperly shutdowned.\n\n[1]\nODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: 00000000dacb411a object type: timer_list hint: nilfs_construction_timeout\nCall trace:\n nilfs_segctor_destroy fs/nilfs2/segment.c:2811 [inline]\n nilfs_detach_log_writer+0x668/0x8cc fs/nilfs2/segment.c:2877\n nilfs_put_super+0x4c/0x12c fs/nilfs2/super.c:509",
