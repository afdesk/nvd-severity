  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmost: usb: hdm_probe: Fix calling put_device() before device initialization\n\nThe early error path in hdm_probe() can jump to err_free_mdev before\n&mdev->dev has been initialized with device_initialize(). Calling\nput_device(&mdev->dev) there triggers a device core WARN and ends up\ninvoking kref_put(&kobj->kref, kobject_release) on an uninitialized\nkobject.\n\nIn this path the private struct was only kmalloc'ed and the intended\nrelease is effectively kfree(mdev) anyway, so free it directly instead\nof calling put_device() on an uninitialized device.\n\nThis removes the WARNING and fixes the pre-initialization error path.",
