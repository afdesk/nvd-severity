  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: avoid infinite loops due to corrupted subpage compact indexes\n\nRobert reported an infinite loop observed by two crafted images.\n\nThe root cause is that `clusterofs` can be larger than `lclustersize`\nfor !NONHEAD `lclusters` in corrupted subpage compact indexes, e.g.:\n\n  blocksize = lclustersize = 512   lcn = 6   clusterofs = 515\n\nMove the corresponding check for full compress indexes to\n`z_erofs_load_lcluster_from_disk()` to also cover subpage compact\ncompress indexes.\n\nIt also fixes the position of `m->type >= Z_EROFS_LCLUSTER_TYPE_MAX`\ncheck, since it should be placed right after\n`z_erofs_load_{compact,full}_lcluster()`.",
