  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: rtl8723bs: fix stack buffer overflow in OnAssocReq IE parsing\n\nThe Supported Rates IE length from an incoming Association Request frame\nwas used directly as the memcpy() length when copying into a fixed-size\n16-byte stack buffer (supportRate). A malicious station can advertise an\nIE length larger than 16 bytes, causing a stack buffer overflow.\n\nClamp ie_len to the buffer size before copying the Supported Rates IE,\nand correct the bounds check when merging Extended Supported Rates to\nprevent a second potential overflow.\n\nThis prevents kernel stack corruption triggered by malformed association\nrequests.",
