  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in rtw_get_ie() parser\n\nThe Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie() trusted the length\nbyte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after\nthe 2-byte header) fits inside the remaining frame buffer. A malformed\nframe can advertise an IE length larger than the available data, causing\nthe parser to increment its pointer beyond the buffer end. This results\nin out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite loop.\n\nFix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit\nbefore accepting the IE or advancing to the next element.\n\nThis prevents OOB reads and ensures the parser terminates safely on\nmalformed frames.",
