  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbfs: Reconstruct file type when loading from disk\n\nsyzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when\nthe S_IFMT bits of the 32bits \"mode\" field loaded from disk are corrupted\nor when the 32bits \"attributes\" field loaded from disk are corrupted.\n\nA documentation says that BFS uses only lower 9 bits of the \"mode\" field.\nBut I can't find an explicit explanation that the unused upper 23 bits\n(especially, the S_IFMT bits) are initialized with 0.\n\nTherefore, ignore the S_IFMT bits of the \"mode\" field loaded from disk.\nAlso, verify that the value of the \"attributes\" field loaded from disk is\neither BFS_VREG or BFS_VDIR (because BFS supports only regular files and\nthe root directory).",
