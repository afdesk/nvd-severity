  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: Fix race condition between concurrent dwc3_remove_requests() call paths\n\nThis patch addresses a race condition caused by unsynchronized\nexecution of multiple call paths invoking `dwc3_remove_requests()`,\nleading to premature freeing of USB requests and subsequent crashes.\n\nThree distinct execution paths interact with `dwc3_remove_requests()`:\nPath 1:\nTriggered via `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()` during USB reset\nhandling. The call stack includes:\n- `dwc3_ep0_reset_state()`\n- `dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart()`\n- `dwc3_ep0_out_start()`\n- `dwc3_remove_requests()`\n- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`\n\nPath 2:\nAlso initiated from `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()`, but through\n`dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`. The call stack includes:\n- `dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`\n- `dwc3_remove_requests()`\n- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`\n\nPath 3:\nOccurs independently during `adb root` execution, which triggers\nUSB function unbind and bind operations. The sequence includes:\n- `gserial_disconnect()`\n- `usb_ep_disable()`\n- `dwc3_gadget_ep_disable()`\n- `dwc3_remove_requests()` with `-ESHUTDOWN` status\n\nPath 3 operates asynchronously and lacks synchronization with Paths\n1 and 2. When Path 3 completes, it disables endpoints and frees 'out'\nrequests. If Paths 1 or 2 are still processing these requests,\naccessing freed memory leads to a crash due to use-after-free conditions.\n\nTo fix this added check for request completion and skip processing\nif already completed and added the request status for ep0 while queue.",
