  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: storage: Fix memory leak in USB bulk transport\n\nA kernel memory leak was identified by the 'ioctl_sg01' test from Linux\nTest Project (LTP). The following bytes were mainly observed: 0x53425355.\n\nWhen USB storage devices incorrectly skip the data phase with status data,\nthe code extracts/validates the CSW from the sg buffer, but fails to clear\nit afterwards. This leaves status protocol data in srb's transfer buffer,\nsuch as the US_BULK_CS_SIGN 'USBS' signature observed here. Thus, this can\nlead to USB protocols leaks to user space through SCSI generic (/dev/sg*)\ninterfaces, such as the one seen here when the LTP test requested 512 KiB.\n\nFix the leak by zeroing the CSW data in srb's transfer buffer immediately\nafter the validation of devices that skip data phase.\n\nNote: Differently from CVE-2018-1000204, which fixed a big leak by zero-\ning pages at allocation time, this leak occurs after allocation, when USB\nprotocol data is written to already-allocated sg pages.",
