  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/memfd: fix information leak in hugetlb folios\n\nWhen allocating hugetlb folios for memfd, three initialization steps are\nmissing:\n\n1. Folios are not zeroed, leading to kernel memory disclosure to userspace\n2. Folios are not marked uptodate before adding to page cache\n3. hugetlb_fault_mutex is not taken before hugetlb_add_to_page_cache()\n\nThe memfd allocation path bypasses the normal page fault handler\n(hugetlb_no_page) which would handle all of these initialization steps. \nThis is problematic especially for udmabuf use cases where folios are\npinned and directly accessed by userspace via DMA.\n\nFix by matching the initialization pattern used in hugetlb_no_page():\n- Zero the folio using folio_zero_user() which is optimized for huge pages\n- Mark it uptodate with folio_mark_uptodate()\n- Take hugetlb_fault_mutex before adding to page cache to prevent races\n\nThe folio_zero_user() change also fixes a potential security issue where\nuninitialized kernel memory could be disclosed to userspace through read()\nor mmap() operations on the memfd.",
