  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Avoid btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() NULL deref\n\nIn btusb_mtk_setup(), we set `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` to:\n  usb_ifnum_to_if(data->udev, MTK_ISO_IFNUM)\n\nThat function can return NULL in some cases. Even when it returns\nNULL, though, we still go on to call btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf().\n\nAs of commit e9087e828827 (\"Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for\nusb_driver_claim_interface()\"), calling btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf()\nwhen `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` is NULL will cause a crash because\nwe'll end up passing a bad pointer to device_lock(). Prior to that\ncommit we'd pass the NULL pointer directly to\nusb_driver_claim_interface() which would detect it and return an\nerror, which was handled.\n\nResolve the crash in btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() by adding a NULL check\nat the start of the function. This makes the code handle a NULL\n`btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` the same way it did before the problematic\ncommit (just with a slight change to the error message printed).",
