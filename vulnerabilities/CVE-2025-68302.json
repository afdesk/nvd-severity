  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sxgbe: fix potential NULL dereference in sxgbe_rx()\n\nCurrently, when skb is null, the driver prints an error and then\ndereferences skb on the next line.\n\nTo fix this, let's add a 'break' after the error message to switch\nto sxgbe_rx_refill(), which is similar to the approach taken by the\nother drivers in this particular case, e.g. calxeda with xgmac_rx().\n\nFound during a code review.",
