  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: Prevents free active kevent\n\nThe root cause of this issue are:\n1. When probing the usbnet device, executing usbnet_link_change(dev, 0, 0);\nput the kevent work in global workqueue. However, the kevent has not yet\nbeen scheduled when the usbnet device is unregistered. Therefore, executing\nfree_netdev() results in the \"free active object (kevent)\" error reported\nhere.\n\n2. Another factor is that when calling usbnet_disconnect()->unregister_netdev(),\nif the usbnet device is up, ndo_stop() is executed to cancel the kevent.\nHowever, because the device is not up, ndo_stop() is not executed.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to cancel the kevent before executing\nfree_netdev().",
