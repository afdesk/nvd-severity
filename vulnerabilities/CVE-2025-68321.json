  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npage_pool: always add GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations\n\nDriver authors often forget to add GFP_NOWARN for page allocation\nfrom the datapath. This is annoying to users as OOMs are a fact\nof life, and we pretty much expect network Rx to hit page allocation\nfailures during OOM. Make page pool add GFP_NOWARN for ATOMIC allocations\nby default.",
