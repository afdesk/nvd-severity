  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop\n\nIn cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen\nand backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes\nthat the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this\nassumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent\nqdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog\naccounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference\n(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).\n\nThis patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by\nobserving the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()\ncalls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()\nreturns NET_XMIT_CN.\n\nTo ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new\nvariable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged.",
