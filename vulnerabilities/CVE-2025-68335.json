  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()\n\nSyzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from\nthe fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),\nsubdevice dev->read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to\n&struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of\n&s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.\n\nMitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from\npcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its\nsupport for async commands, everything async-related will be\nhandled via subdevice's own ->cancel() function in\ncomedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no\nsupport for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need\nto cancel anything either.\n\n[1] Syzbot crash:\nOops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000005: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000028-0x000000000000002f]\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 6050 Comm: syz.0.18 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/18/2025\nRIP: 0010:pcl818_ai_cancel+0x69/0x3f0 drivers/comedi/drivers/pcl818.c:762\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n pcl818_detach+0x66/0xd0 drivers/comedi/drivers/pcl818.c:1115\n comedi_device_detach_locked+0x178/0x750 drivers/comedi/drivers.c:207\n do_devconfig_ioctl drivers/comedi/comedi_fops.c:848 [inline]\n comedi_unlocked_ioctl+0xcde/0x1020 drivers/comedi/comedi_fops.c:2178\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:597 [inline]\n...",
