  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: microchip: Don't free uninitialized ksz_irq\n\nIf something goes wrong at setup, ksz_irq_free() can be called on\nuninitialized ksz_irq (for example when ksz_ptp_irq_setup() fails). It\nleads to freeing uninitialized IRQ numbers and/or domains.\n\nUse dsa_switch_for_each_user_port_continue_reverse() in the error path\nto iterate only over the fully initialized ports.",
