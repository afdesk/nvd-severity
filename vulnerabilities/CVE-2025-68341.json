  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nveth: reduce XDP no_direct return section to fix race\n\nAs explain in commit fa349e396e48 (\"veth: Fix race with AF_XDP exposing\nold or uninitialized descriptors\") for veth there is a chance after\nnapi_complete_done() that another CPU can manage start another NAPI\ninstance running veth_pool(). For NAPI this is correctly handled as the\nnapi_schedule_prep() check will prevent multiple instances from getting\nscheduled, but for the remaining code in veth_pool() this can run\nconcurrent with the newly started NAPI instance.\n\nThe problem/race is that xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct() isn't\ndesigned to be nested.\n\nPrior to commit 401cb7dae813 (\"net: Reference bpf_redirect_info via\ntask_struct on PREEMPT_RT.\") the temporary BPF net context\nbpf_redirect_info was stored per CPU, where this wasn't an issue. Since\nthis commit the BPF context is stored in 'current' task_struct. When\nrunning veth in threaded-NAPI mode, then the kthread becomes the storage\narea. Now a race exists between two concurrent veth_pool() function calls\none exiting NAPI and one running new NAPI, both using the same BPF net\ncontext.\n\nRace is when another CPU gets within the xdp_set_return_frame_no_direct()\nsection before exiting veth_pool() calls the clear-function\nxdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct().",
