  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data\n\nThe URB received in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() contains a struct\ngs_host_frame. The length of the data after the header depends on the\ngs_host_frame hf::flags and the active device features (e.g. time\nstamping).\n\nIntroduce a new function gs_usb_get_minimum_length() and check that we have\nat least received the required amount of data before accessing it. Only\ncopy the data to that skb that has actually been received.\n\n[mkl: rename gs_usb_get_minimum_length() -> +gs_usb_get_minimum_rx_length()]",
