  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing header\n\nThe driver expects to receive a struct gs_host_frame in\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback().\n\nUse struct_group to describe the header of the struct gs_host_frame and\ncheck that we have at least received the header before accessing any\nmembers of it.\n\nTo resubmit the URB, do not dereference the pointer chain\n\"dev->parent->hf_size_rx\" but use \"parent->hf_size_rx\" instead. Since\n\"urb->context\" contains \"parent\", it is always defined, while \"dev\" is not\ndefined if the URB it too short.",
