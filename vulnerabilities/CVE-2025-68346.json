  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: dice: fix buffer overflow in detect_stream_formats()\n\nThe function detect_stream_formats() reads the stream_count value directly\nfrom a FireWire device without validating it. This can lead to\nout-of-bounds writes when a malicious device provides a stream_count value\ngreater than MAX_STREAMS.\n\nFix by applying the same validation to both TX and RX stream counts in\ndetect_stream_formats().",
