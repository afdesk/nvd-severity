  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: firewire-motu: fix buffer overflow in hwdep read for DSP events\n\nThe DSP event handling code in hwdep_read() could write more bytes to\nthe user buffer than requested, when a user provides a buffer smaller\nthan the event header size (8 bytes).\n\nFix by using min_t() to clamp the copy size, This ensures we never copy\nmore than the user requested.",
