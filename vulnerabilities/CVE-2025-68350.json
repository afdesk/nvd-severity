  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: fix divide-by-zero in exfat_allocate_bitmap\n\nThe variable max_ra_count can be 0 in exfat_allocate_bitmap(),\nwhich causes a divide-by-zero error in the subsequent modulo operation\n(i % max_ra_count), leading to a system crash.\nWhen max_ra_count is 0, it means that readahead is not used. This patch\nload the bitmap without readahead.",
