  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: ch341: fix out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one\n\nDiscovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.\n\nThe 'len' variable is calculated as 'min(32, trans->len + 1)',\nwhich includes the 1-byte command header.\n\nWhen copying data from 'trans->tx_buf' to 'ch341->tx_buf + 1', using 'len'\nas the length is incorrect because:\n\n1. It causes an out-of-bounds read from 'trans->tx_buf' (which has size\n   'trans->len', i.e., 'len - 1' in this context).\n2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to 'ch341->tx_buf' if 'len' is\n   CH341_PACKET_LENGTH (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341->tx_buf + 1\n   overflows the buffer.\n\nFix this by copying 'len - 1' bytes.",
