  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: core: Protect regulator_supply_alias_list with regulator_list_mutex\n\nregulator_supply_alias_list was accessed without any locking in\nregulator_supply_alias(), regulator_register_supply_alias(), and\nregulator_unregister_supply_alias(). Concurrent registration,\nunregistration and lookups can race, leading to:\n\n1 use-after-free if an alias entry is removed while being read,\n2 duplicate entries when two threads register the same alias,\n3 inconsistent alias mappings observed by consumers.\n\nProtect all traversals, insertions and deletions on\nregulator_supply_alias_list with the existing regulator_list_mutex.",
