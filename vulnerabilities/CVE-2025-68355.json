  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix exclusive map memory leak\n\nWhen excl_prog_hash is 0 and excl_prog_hash_size is non-zero, the map also\nneeds to be freed. Otherwise, the map memory will not be reclaimed, just\nlike the memory leak problem reported by syzbot [1].\n\nsyzbot reported:\nBUG: memory leak\n  backtrace (crc 7b9fb9b4):\n    map_create+0x322/0x11e0 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:1512\n    __sys_bpf+0x3556/0x3610 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:6131",
