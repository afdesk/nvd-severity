  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well\n\nSince commit 222f2c7c6d14 (\"iomap: always run error completions in user\ncontext\"), read error completions are deferred to s_dio_done_wq.  This\nmeans the workqueue also needs to be allocated for async reads.",
