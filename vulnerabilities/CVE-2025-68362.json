  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtl818x: rtl8187: Fix potential buffer underflow in rtl8187_rx_cb()\n\nThe rtl8187_rx_cb() calculates the rx descriptor header address\nby subtracting its size from the skb tail pointer.\nHowever, it does not validate if the received packet\n(skb->len from urb->actual_length) is large enough to contain this\nheader.\n\nIf a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer\nunderflow, reading memory before the start of the skb data area,\nand causing a kernel panic.\n\nAdd length checks for both rtl8187 and rtl8187b descriptor headers\nbefore attempting to access them, dropping the packet cleanly if the\ncheck fails.",
