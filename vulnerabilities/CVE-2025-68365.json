  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: Initialize allocated memory before use\n\nKMSAN reports: Multiple uninitialized values detected:\n\n- KMSAN: uninit-value in ntfs_read_hdr (3)\n- KMSAN: uninit-value in bcmp (3)\n\nMemory is allocated by __getname(), which is a wrapper for\nkmem_cache_alloc(). This memory is used before being properly\ncleared. Change kmem_cache_alloc() to kmem_cache_zalloc() to\nproperly allocate and clear memory before use.",
