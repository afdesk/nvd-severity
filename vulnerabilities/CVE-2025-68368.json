  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd: init bioset in mddev_init\n\nIO operations may be needed before md_run(), such as updating metadata\nafter writing sysfs. Without bioset, this triggers a NULL pointer\ndereference as below:\n\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020\n Call Trace:\n  md_update_sb+0x658/0xe00\n  new_level_store+0xc5/0x120\n  md_attr_store+0xc9/0x1e0\n  sysfs_kf_write+0x6f/0xa0\n  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x141/0x2a0\n  vfs_write+0x1fc/0x5a0\n  ksys_write+0x79/0x180\n  __x64_sys_write+0x1d/0x30\n  x64_sys_call+0x2818/0x2880\n  do_syscall_64+0xa9/0x580\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nReproducer\n```\n  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l1 -n2 /dev/sd[cd]\n  echo inactive > /sys/block/md0/md/array_state\n  echo 10 > /sys/block/md0/md/new_level\n```\n\nmddev_init() can only be called once per mddev, no need to test if bioset\nhas been initialized anymore.",
