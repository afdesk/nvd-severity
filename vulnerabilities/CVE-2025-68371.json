  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: smartpqi: Fix device resources accessed after device removal\n\nCorrect possible race conditions during device removal.\n\nPreviously, a scheduled work item to reset a LUN could still execute\nafter the device was removed, leading to use-after-free and other\nresource access issues.\n\nThis race condition occurs because the abort handler may schedule a LUN\nreset concurrently with device removal via sdev_destroy(), leading to\nuse-after-free and improper access to freed resources.\n\n  - Check in the device reset handler if the device is still present in\n    the controller's SCSI device list before running; if not, the reset\n    is skipped.\n\n  - Cancel any pending TMF work that has not started in sdev_destroy().\n\n  - Ensure device freeing in sdev_destroy() is done while holding the\n    LUN reset mutex to avoid races with ongoing resets.",
