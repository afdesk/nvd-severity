  "Description": "In Apache Airflow versions before 3.1.6, when rendered template fields in a Dag exceed [core]\u00a0max_templated_field_length, sensitive values could be exposed in cleartext in the Rendered Templates UI. This occurred because serialization of those fields used a secrets masker instance that did not include user-registered mask_secret() patterns, so secrets were not reliably masked before truncation and display.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to 3.1.6 or later, which fixes this issue",
