In versions 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.20 and 3.0.0 through 4.16.16,  unauthenticated users can trigger database backup operations via specific admin actions, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or information disclosure. Users should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate the issue. Craft 3 users should update to the latest Craft 4 and 5 releases, which include the fixes.",
