  "Description": "Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub. Prior to versions 1.6.13, 1.7.14, 1.8.15, and 1.9.2, a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in Fedify's document loader. The HTML parsing regex at packages/fedify/src/runtime/docloader.ts:259 contains nested quantifiers that cause catastrophic backtracking when processing maliciously crafted HTML responses. This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.13, 1.7.14, 1.8.15, and 1.9.2.",
