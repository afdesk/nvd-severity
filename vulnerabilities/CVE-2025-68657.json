  "Description": "Espressif ESP-IDF USB Host HID (Human Interface Device) Driver allows access to HID devices. Prior to 1.1.0, calls to hid_host_device_close() can free the same usb_transfer_t twice. The USB event callback and user code share the hid_iface_t state without locking, so both can tear down a READY interface simultaneously, corrupting heap metadata inside the ESP USB host stack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.1.0.",
