  "Description": "KAYSUS KS-WR3600 routers with firmware 1.0.5.9.1 enable the SSH service enabled by default on the LAN interface. The root account is configured with no password, and administrators cannot disable SSH or enforce authentication via the CLI or web GUI. This allows any LAN-adjacent attacker to trivially gain root shell access and execute arbitrary commands with full privileges.",
