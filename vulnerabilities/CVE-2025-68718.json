  "Description": "KAYSUS KS-WR1200 routers with firmware 107 expose SSH and TELNET services on the LAN interface with hardcoded root credentials (root:12345678). The administrator cannot disable these services or change the hardcoded password. (Changing the management GUI password does not affect SSH/TELNET authentication.) Any LAN-adjacent attacker can trivially log in with root privileges.",
