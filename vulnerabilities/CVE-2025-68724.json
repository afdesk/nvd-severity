  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: asymmetric_keys - prevent overflow in asymmetric_key_generate_id\n\nUse check_add_overflow() to guard against potential integer overflows\nwhen adding the binary blob lengths and the size of an asymmetric_key_id\nstructure and return ERR_PTR(-EOVERFLOW) accordingly. This prevents a\npossible buffer overflow when copying data from potentially malicious\nX.509 certificate fields that can be arbitrarily large, such as ASN.1\nINTEGER serial numbers, issuer names, etc.",
