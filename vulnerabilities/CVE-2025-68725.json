  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Do not let BPF test infra emit invalid GSO types to stack\n\nYinhao et al. reported that their fuzzer tool was able to trigger a\nskb_warn_bad_offload() from netif_skb_features() -> gso_features_check().\nWhen a BPF program - triggered via BPF test infra - pushes the packet\nto the loopback device via bpf_clone_redirect() then mentioned offload\nwarning can be seen. GSO-related features are then rightfully disabled.\n\nWe get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting\ngso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense\nthat this warning triggers since the GSO properties are malformed due\nto the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could be marked non-trustworthy\nthrough setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific\nassumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further\ninto the GSO engine in the first place.\n\nThe checks were added in 121d57af308d (\"gso: validate gso_type in GSO\nhandlers\") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine\na protocol with a non-matching gso_type. If we would want to drop such\npackets, gso_features_check() currently only returns feature flags via\nnetif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs\ncould be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be\nan additional check in the fast-path for a very corner case. Given\nbpf_clone_redirect() is the only place where BPF test infra could emit\nsuch packets, lets reject them right there.",
