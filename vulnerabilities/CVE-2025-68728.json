  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nntfs3: fix uninit memory after failed mi_read in mi_format_new\n\nFix a KMSAN un-init bug found by syzkaller.\n\nntfs_get_bh() expects a buffer from sb_getblk(), that buffer may not be\nuptodate. We do not bring the buffer uptodate before setting it as\nuptodate. If the buffer were to not be uptodate, it could mean adding a\nbuffer with un-init data to the mi record. Attempting to load that record\nwill trigger KMSAN.\n\nAvoid this by setting the buffer as uptodate, if it\u2019s not already, by\noverwriting it.",
