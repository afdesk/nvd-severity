  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpu: host1x: Fix race in syncpt alloc/free\n\nFix race condition between host1x_syncpt_alloc()\nand host1x_syncpt_put() by using kref_put_mutex()\ninstead of kref_put() + manual mutex locking.\n\nThis ensures no thread can acquire the\nsyncpt_mutex after the refcount drops to zero\nbut before syncpt_release acquires it.\nThis prevents races where syncpoints could\nbe allocated while still being cleaned up\nfrom a previous release.\n\nRemove explicit mutex locking in syncpt_release\nas kref_put_mutex() handles this atomically.",
