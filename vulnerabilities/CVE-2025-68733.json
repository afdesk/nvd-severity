  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmack: fix bug: unprivileged task can create labels\n\nIf an unprivileged task is allowed to relabel itself\n(/smack/relabel-self is not empty),\nit can freely create new labels by writing their\nnames into own /proc/PID/attr/smack/current\n\nThis occurs because do_setattr() imports\nthe provided label in advance,\nbefore checking \"relabel-self\" list.\n\nThis change ensures that the \"relabel-self\" list\nis checked before importing the label.",
