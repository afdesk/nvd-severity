  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panthor: Prevent potential UAF in group creation\n\nThis commit prevents the possibility of a use after free issue in the\nGROUP_CREATE ioctl function, which arose as pointer to the group is\naccessed in that ioctl function after storing it in the Xarray.\nA malicious userspace can second guess the handle of a group and try\nto call GROUP_DESTROY ioctl from another thread around the same time\nas GROUP_CREATE ioctl.\n\nTo prevent the use after free exploit, this commit uses a mark on an\nentry of group pool Xarray which is added just before returning from\nthe GROUP_CREATE ioctl function. The mark is checked for all ioctls\nthat specify the group handle and so userspace won't be abe to delete\na group that isn't marked yet.\n\nv2: Add R-bs and fixes tags",
