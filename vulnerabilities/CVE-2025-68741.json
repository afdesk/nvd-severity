  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: qla2xxx: Fix improper freeing of purex item\n\nIn qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb(), an item is allocated via\nqla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), which internally calls\nqla24xx_alloc_purex_item().\n\nThe qla24xx_alloc_purex_item() function may return a pre-allocated item\nfrom a per-adapter pool for small allocations, instead of dynamically\nallocating memory with kzalloc().\n\nAn error handling path in qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb() incorrectly uses\nkfree() to release the item. If the item was from the pre-allocated\npool, calling kfree() on it is a bug that can lead to memory corruption.\n\nFix this by using the correct deallocation function,\nqla24xx_free_purex_item(), which properly handles both dynamically\nallocated and pre-allocated items.",
