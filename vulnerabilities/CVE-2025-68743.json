  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmshv: Fix create memory region overlap check\n\nThe current check is incorrect; it only checks if the beginning or end\nof a region is within an existing region. This doesn't account for\nuserspace specifying a region that begins before and ends after an\nexisting region.\n\nChange the logic to a range intersection check against gfns and uaddrs\nfor each region.\n\nRemove mshv_partition_region_by_uaddr() as it is no longer used.",
