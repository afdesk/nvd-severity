  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Free special fields when update [lru_,]percpu_hash maps\n\nAs [lru_,]percpu_hash maps support BPF_KPTR_{REF,PERCPU}, missing\ncalls to 'bpf_obj_free_fields()' in 'pcpu_copy_value()' could cause the\nmemory referenced by BPF_KPTR_{REF,PERCPU} fields to be held until the\nmap gets freed.\n\nFix this by calling 'bpf_obj_free_fields()' after\n'copy_map_value[,_long]()' in 'pcpu_copy_value()'.",
