  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtc: amlogic-a4: fix double free caused by devm\n\nThe clock obtained via devm_clk_get_enabled() is automatically managed\nby devres and will be disabled and freed on driver detach. Manually\ncalling clk_disable_unprepare() in error path and remove function\ncauses double free.\n\nRemove the redundant clk_disable_unprepare() calls from the probe\nerror path and aml_rtc_remove(), allowing the devm framework to\nautomatically manage the clock lifecycle.",
