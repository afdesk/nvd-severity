  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbacklight: led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs\n\nLED Backlight is a consumer of one or multiple LED class devices, but\ndevlink is currently unable to create correct supplier-producer links when\nthe supplier is a class device. It creates instead a link where the\nsupplier is the parent of the expected device.\n\nOne consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.\n\nIssues happen for example with the following sections in a device tree\noverlay:\n\n    // An LED driver chip\n    pca9632@62 {\n        compatible = \"nxp,pca9632\";\n        reg = <0x62>;\n\n\t// ...\n\n        addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {\n            reg = <3>;\n            label = \"addon:led:pwm\";\n        };\n    };\n\n    backlight-addon {\n        compatible = \"led-backlight\";\n        leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;\n        brightness-levels = <255>;\n        default-brightness-level = <255>;\n    };\n\nIn this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon\n(consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier). Instead it is created between the\nbacklight-addon (consumer) and the parent of the pca9632@62, which is\ntypically the I2C bus adapter.\n\nOn removal of the above overlay, the LED driver can be removed before the\nbacklight device, resulting in:\n\n    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010\n    ...\n    Call trace:\n     led_put+0xe0/0x140\n     devm_led_release+0x6c/0x98\n\nAnother way to reproduce the bug without any device tree overlays is\nunbinding the LED class device (pca9632@62) before unbinding the consumer\n(backlight-addon):\n\n  echo 11-0062 >/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/leds-pca963x/unbind\n  echo ...backlight-dock >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/led-backlight/unbind\n\nFix by adding a devlink between the consuming led-backlight device and the\nsupplying LED device, as other drivers and subsystems do as well.",
