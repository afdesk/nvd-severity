  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtl818x: Fix potential memory leaks in rtl8180_init_rx_ring()\n\nIn rtl8180_init_rx_ring(), memory is allocated for skb packets and DMA\nallocations in a loop. When an allocation fails, the previously\nsuccessful allocations are not freed on exit.\n\nFix that by jumping to err_free_rings label on error, which calls\nrtl8180_free_rx_ring() to free the allocations. Remove the free of\nrx_ring in rtl8180_init_rx_ring() error path, and set the freed\npriv->rx_buf entry to null, to avoid double free.",
