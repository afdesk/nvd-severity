  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/amd: Fix potential out-of-bounds read in iommu_mmio_show\n\nIn iommu_mmio_write(), it validates the user-provided offset with the\ncheck: `iommu->dbg_mmio_offset > iommu->mmio_phys_end - 4`.\nThis assumes a 4-byte access. However, the corresponding\nshow handler, iommu_mmio_show(), uses readq() to perform an 8-byte\n(64-bit) read.\n\nIf a user provides an offset equal to `mmio_phys_end - 4`, the check\npasses, and will lead to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read.\n\nFix this by adjusting the boundary check to use sizeof(u64), which\ncorresponds to the size of the readq() operation.",
