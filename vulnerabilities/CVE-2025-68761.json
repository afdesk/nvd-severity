  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfs: fix potential use after free in hfs_correct_next_unused_CNID()\n\nThis code calls hfs_bnode_put(node) which drops the refcount and then\ndreferences \"node\" on the next line.  It's only safe to use \"node\"\nwhen we're holding a reference so flip these two lines around.",
