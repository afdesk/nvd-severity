  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: netpoll: initialize work queue before error checks\n\nPrevent a kernel warning when netconsole setup fails on devices with\nIFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL flag. The warning (at kernel/workqueue.c:4242 in\n__flush_work) occurs because the cleanup path tries to cancel an\nuninitialized work queue.\n\nWhen __netpoll_setup() encounters a device with IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL,\nit fails early and calls skb_pool_flush() for cleanup. This function\ncalls cancel_work_sync(&np->refill_wq), but refill_wq hasn't been\ninitialized yet, triggering the warning.\n\nMove INIT_WORK() to the beginning of __netpoll_setup(), ensuring the\nwork queue is properly initialized before any potential failure points.\nThis allows the cleanup path to safely cancel the work queue regardless\nof where the setup fails.",
