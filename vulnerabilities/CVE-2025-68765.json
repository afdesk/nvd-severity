  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmt76: mt7615: Fix memory leak in mt7615_mcu_wtbl_sta_add()\n\nIn mt7615_mcu_wtbl_sta_add(), an skb sskb is allocated. If the\nsubsequent call to mt76_connac_mcu_alloc_wtbl_req() fails, the function\nreturns an error without freeing sskb, leading to a memory leak.\n\nFix this by calling dev_kfree_skb() on sskb in the error handling path\nto ensure it is properly released.",
