  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk\n\nsyzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when\nthe S_IFMT bits of the 16bits \"mode\" field loaded from disk are corrupted.\n\nAccording to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS\n8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized\nwith 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when\nthe \"mode\" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be\nS_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/\nS_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir == 0.",
