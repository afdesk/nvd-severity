  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninet: frags: flush pending skbs in fqdir_pre_exit()\n\nWe have been seeing occasional deadlocks on pernet_ops_rwsem since\nSeptember in NIPA. The stuck task was usually modprobe (often loading\na driver like ipvlan), trying to take the lock as a Writer.\nlockdep does not track readers for rwsems so the read wasn't obvious\nfrom the reports.\n\nOn closer inspection the Reader holding the lock was conntrack looping\nforever in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list(). Based on past experience\nwith occasional NIPA crashes I looked thru the tests which run before\nthe crash and noticed that the crash follows ip_defrag.sh. An immediate\nred flag. Scouring thru (de)fragmentation queues reveals skbs sitting\naround, holding conntrack references.\n\nThe problem is that since conntrack depends on nf_defrag_ipv6,\nnf_defrag_ipv6 will load first. Since nf_defrag_ipv6 loads first its\nnetns exit hooks run _after_ conntrack's netns exit hook.\n\nFlush all fragment queue SKBs during fqdir_pre_exit() to release\nconntrack references before conntrack cleanup runs. Also flush\nthe queues in timer expiry handlers when they discover fqdir->dead\nis set, in case packet sneaks in while we're running the pre_exit\nflush.\n\nThe commit under Fixes is not exactly the culprit, but I think\npreviously the timer firing would eventually unblock the spinning\nconntrack.",
