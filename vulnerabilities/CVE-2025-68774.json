  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create\n\nWhen sync() and link() are called concurrently, both threads may\nenter hfs_bnode_find() without finding the node in the hash table\nand proceed to create it.\n\nThread A:\n  hfsplus_write_inode()\n    -> hfsplus_write_system_inode()\n      -> hfs_btree_write()\n        -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n          -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nThread B:\n  hfsplus_create_cat()\n    -> hfs_brec_insert()\n      -> hfs_bnode_split()\n        -> hfs_bmap_alloc()\n          -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n            -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nIn this case, thread A creates the bnode, sets refcnt=1, and hashes it.\nThread B also tries to create the same bnode, notices it has already\nbeen inserted, drops its own instance, and uses the hashed one without\ngetting the node.\n\n```\n\n\tnode2 = hfs_bnode_findhash(tree, cnid);\n\tif (!node2) {                                 <- Thread A\n\t\thash = hfs_bnode_hash(cnid);\n\t\tnode->next_hash = tree->node_hash[hash];\n\t\ttree->node_hash[hash] = node;\n\t\ttree->node_hash_cnt++;\n\t} else {                                      <- Thread B\n\t\tspin_unlock(&tree->hash_lock);\n\t\tkfree(node);\n\t\twait_event(node2->lock_wq,\n\t\t\t!test_bit(HFS_BNODE_NEW, &node2->flags));\n\t\treturn node2;\n\t}\n```\n\nHowever, hfs_bnode_find() requires each call to take a reference.\nHere both threads end up setting refcnt=1. When they later put the node,\nthis triggers:\n\nBUG_ON(!atomic_read(&node->refcnt))\n\nIn this scenario, Thread B in fact finds the node in the hash table\nrather than creating a new one, and thus must take a reference.\n\nFix this by calling hfs_bnode_get() when reusing a bnode newly created by\nanother thread to ensure the refcount is updated correctly.\n\nA similar bug was fixed in HFS long ago in commit\na9dc087fd3c4 (\"fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create\")\nbut the same issue remained in HFS+ until now.",
