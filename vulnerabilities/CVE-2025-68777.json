  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: ti_am335x_tsc - fix off-by-one error in wire_order validation\n\nThe current validation 'wire_order[i] > ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins)' allows\nwire_order[i] to equal ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins), which causes out-of-bounds\naccess when used as index in 'config_pins[wire_order[i]]'.\n\nSince config_pins has 4 elements (indices 0-3), the valid range for\nwire_order should be 0-3. Fix the off-by-one error by using >= instead\nof > in the validation check.",
