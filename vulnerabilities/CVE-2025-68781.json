  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal\n\nThe delayed work item otg_event is initialized in fsl_otg_conf() and\nscheduled under two conditions:\n1. When a host controller binds to the OTG controller.\n2. When the USB ID pin state changes (cable insertion/removal).\n\nA race condition occurs when the device is removed via fsl_otg_remove():\nthe fsl_otg instance may be freed while the delayed work is still pending\nor executing. This leads to use-after-free when the work function\nfsl_otg_event() accesses the already freed memory.\n\nThe problematic scenario:\n\n(detach thread)            | (delayed work)\nfsl_otg_remove()           |\n  kfree(fsl_otg_dev) //FREE| fsl_otg_event()\n                           |   og = container_of(...) //USE\n                           |   og-> //USE\n\nFix this by calling disable_delayed_work_sync() in fsl_otg_remove()\nbefore deallocating the fsl_otg structure. This ensures the delayed work\nis properly canceled and completes execution prior to memory deallocation.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis.",
