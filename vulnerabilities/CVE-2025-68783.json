  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-mixer: us16x08: validate meter packet indices\n\nget_meter_levels_from_urb() parses the 64-byte meter packets sent by\nthe device and fills the per-channel arrays meter_level[],\ncomp_level[] and master_level[] in struct snd_us16x08_meter_store.\n\nCurrently the function derives the channel index directly from the\nmeter packet (MUB2(meter_urb, s) - 1) and uses it to index those\narrays without validating the range. If the packet contains a\nnegative or out-of-range channel number, the driver may write past\nthe end of these arrays.\n\nIntroduce a local channel variable and validate it before updating the\narrays. We reject negative indices, limit meter_level[] and\ncomp_level[] to SND_US16X08_MAX_CHANNELS, and guard master_level[]\nupdates with ARRAY_SIZE(master_level).",
