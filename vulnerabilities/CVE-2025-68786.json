  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: skip lock-range check on equal size to avoid size==0 underflow\n\nWhen size equals the current i_size (including 0), the code used to call\ncheck_lock_range(filp, i_size, size - 1, WRITE), which computes `size - 1`\nand can underflow for size==0. Skip the equal case.",
