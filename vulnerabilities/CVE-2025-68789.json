  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (ibmpex) fix use-after-free in high/low store\n\nThe ibmpex_high_low_store() function retrieves driver data using\ndev_get_drvdata() and uses it without validation. This creates a race\ncondition where the sysfs callback can be invoked after the data\nstructure is freed, leading to use-after-free.\n\nFix by adding a NULL check after dev_get_drvdata(), and reordering\noperations in the deletion path to prevent TOCTOU.",
