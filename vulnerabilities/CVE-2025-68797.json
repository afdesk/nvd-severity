  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nchar: applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl\n\nDiscovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.\n\nIn ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid\nRamIO pointer are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function\nunconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO + VERS) at the\nend.\n\nIf cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist\n(where RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFix this by skipping the readb access when cmd is 6, as this\ncommand is a global information query and does not target a specific\nboard context.",
