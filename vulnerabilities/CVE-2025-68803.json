  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSD: NFSv4 file creation neglects setting ACL\n\nAn NFSv4 client that sets an ACL with a named principal during file\ncreation retrieves the ACL afterwards, and finds that it is only a\ndefault ACL (based on the mode bits) and not the ACL that was\nrequested during file creation. This violates RFC 8881 section\n6.4.1.3: \"the ACL attribute is set as given\".\n\nThe issue occurs in nfsd_create_setattr(), which calls\nnfsd_attrs_valid() to determine whether to call nfsd_setattr().\nHowever, nfsd_attrs_valid() checks only for iattr changes and\nsecurity labels, but not POSIX ACLs. When only an ACL is present,\nthe function returns false, nfsd_setattr() is skipped, and the\nPOSIX ACL is never applied to the inode.\n\nSubsequently, when the client retrieves the ACL, the server finds\nno POSIX ACL on the inode and returns one generated from the file's\nmode bits rather than returning the originally-specified ACL.",
