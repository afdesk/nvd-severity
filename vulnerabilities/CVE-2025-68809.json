  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: vfs: fix race on m_flags in vfs_cache\n\nksmbd maintains delete-on-close and pending-delete state in\nksmbd_inode->m_flags. In vfs_cache.c this field is accessed under\ninconsistent locking: some paths read and modify m_flags under\nci->m_lock while others do so without taking the lock at all.\n\nExamples:\n\n - ksmbd_query_inode_status() and __ksmbd_inode_close() use\n   ci->m_lock when checking or updating m_flags.\n - ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),\n   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete() and ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()\n   used to read and modify m_flags without ci->m_lock.\n\nThis creates a potential data race on m_flags when multiple threads\nopen, close and delete the same file concurrently. In the worst case\ndelete-on-close and pending-delete bits can be lost or observed in an\ninconsistent state, leading to confusing delete semantics (files that\nstay on disk after delete-on-close, or files that disappear while still\nin use).\n\nFix it by:\n\n - Making ksmbd_query_inode_status() look at m_flags under ci->m_lock\n   after dropping inode_hash_lock.\n - Adding ci->m_lock protection to all helpers that read or modify\n   m_flags (ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),\n   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()).\n - Keeping the existing ci->m_lock protection in __ksmbd_inode_close(),\n   and moving the actual unlink/xattr removal outside the lock.\n\nThis unifies the locking around m_flags and removes the data race while\npreserving the existing delete-on-close behaviour.",
