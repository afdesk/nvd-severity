  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: dvb-usb: dtv5100: fix out-of-bounds in dtv5100_i2c_msg()\n\nrlen value is a user-controlled value, but dtv5100_i2c_msg() does not\ncheck the size of the rlen value. Therefore, if it is set to a value\nlarger than sizeof(st->data), an out-of-bounds vuln occurs for st->data.\n\nTherefore, we need to add proper range checking to prevent this vuln.",
