  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: xattr: fix null pointer deref in ext4_raw_inode()\n\nIf ext4_get_inode_loc() fails (e.g. if it returns -EFSCORRUPTED),\niloc.bh will remain set to NULL. Since ext4_xattr_inode_dec_ref_all()\nlacks error checking, this will lead to a null pointer dereference\nin ext4_raw_inode(), called right after ext4_get_inode_loc().\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
