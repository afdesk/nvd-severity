  "Description": "ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to version 7.1.2-12, in the WriteSVGImage function, using an int variable to store number_attributes caused an integer overflow. This, in turn, triggered a buffer overflow and caused a DoS attack. Version 7.1.2-12 fixes the issue.",
