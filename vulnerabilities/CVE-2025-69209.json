  "Description": "ArduinoCore-avr contains the source code and configuration files of the Arduino AVR Boards platform. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.8.7 allows an attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow when converting floating-point values to strings with high precision. By passing very large `decimalPlaces` values to the affected String constructors or concat methods, the `dtostrf` function writes beyond fixed-size stack buffers, causing memory corruption and denial of service. Under specific conditions, this could enable arbitrary code execution on AVR-based Arduino boards.\n\n### Patches\n\n- The Fix is included starting from the `1.8.7` release available from the following link [ArduinoCore-avr v1.8.7](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr)\n\n- The Fixing Commit is available at the following link [1a6a417f89c8901dad646efce74ae9d3ddebfd59](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/pull/613/commits/1a6a417f89c8901dad646efce74ae9d3ddebfd59)\n\n### References\n\n- [ASEC-26-001 ArduinoCore-avr vXXXX Resolves Buffer Overflow Vulnerability](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/XXXXX)\n\n### Credits\n\n- Maxime Rossi Bellom and Ramtine Tofighi Shirazi from SecMate (https://secmate.dev/)",
