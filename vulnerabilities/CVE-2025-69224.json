  "Description": "AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below of the Python HTTP parser may allow a request smuggling attack with the presence of non-ASCII characters. If a pure Python version of AIOHTTP is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.",
