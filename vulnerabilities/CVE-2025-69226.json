  "Description": "AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below enable an attacker to ascertain the existence of absolute path components through the path normalization logic for static files meant to prevent path traversal. If an application uses web.static() (not recommended for production deployments), it may be possible for an attacker to ascertain the existence of path components. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.",
