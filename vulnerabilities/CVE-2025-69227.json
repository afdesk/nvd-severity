  "Description": "AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below allow for an infinite loop to occur when assert statements are bypassed, resulting in a DoS attack when processing a POST body. If optimizations are enabled (-O or PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1), and the application includes a handler that uses the Request.post() method, then an attacker may be able to execute a DoS attack with a specially crafted message. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.",
