  "Description": "WasmEdge is a WebAssembly runtime. Prior to version 0.16.0-alpha.3, a multiplication in `WasmEdge/include/runtime/instance/memory.h` can wrap, causing `checkAccessBound()` to incorrectly allow the access. This leads to a segmentation fault. Version 0.16.0-alpha.3 contains a patch for the issue.",
