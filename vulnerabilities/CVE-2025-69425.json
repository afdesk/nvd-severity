  "Description": "The Ruckus vRIoT IoT Controller\u00a0firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.0 (GA) expose a command execution service on TCP port 2004 running with root privileges. Authentication to this service relies on a hardcoded Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) secret and an embedded static token. An attacker who extracts these credentials from the appliance or a compromised device can generate valid authentication tokens and execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges, resulting in complete system compromise.",
