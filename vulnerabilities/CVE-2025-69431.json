  "Description": "The ZSPACE Q2C NAS contains a vulnerability related to incorrect symbolic link following. Attackers can format a USB drive to ext4, create a symbolic link to its root directory, insert the drive into the NAS device's slot, and then access the USB drive's directory mounted on the NAS using the Samba protocol. This allows them to obtain all files within the NAS system and tamper with those files.",
