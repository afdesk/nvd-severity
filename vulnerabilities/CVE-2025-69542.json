  "Description": "A Command Injection Vulnerability has been discovered in the DHCP daemon service of D-Link DIR895LA1 v102b07. The vulnerability exists in the lease renewal processing logic where the DHCP hostname parameter is directly concatenated into a system command without proper sanitization. When a DHCP client renews an existing lease with a malicious hostname, arbitrary commands can be executed with root privileges.",
