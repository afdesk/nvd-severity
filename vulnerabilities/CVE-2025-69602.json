  "Description": "A session fixation vulnerability exists in 66biolinks v62.0.0 by AltumCode, where the application does not regenerate the session identifier after successful authentication. As a result, the same session cookie value is reused for users logging in from the same browser, allowing an attacker who can set or predict a session ID to potentially hijack an authenticated session.",
