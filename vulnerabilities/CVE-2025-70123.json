  "Description": "An improper input validation and protocol compliance vulnerability in free5GC v4.0.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service. The UPF incorrectly accepts a malformed PFCP Association Setup Request, violating 3GPP TS 29.244. This places the UPF in an inconsistent state where a subsequent valid PFCP Session Establishment Request triggers a cascading failure, disrupting the SMF connection and causing service degradation.",
  "Severity": "HIGH",
  "Score": 7.5,
  "Cvss_v31_vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"
