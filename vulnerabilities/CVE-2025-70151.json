  "Description": "code-projects Scholars Tracking System 1.0 allows an authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution via unrestricted file upload. The endpoints update_profile_picture.php and upload_picture.php store uploaded files in a web-accessible uploads/ directory using the original, user-supplied filename without validating the file type or extension. By uploading a PHP file and then requesting it from /uploads/, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code as the web server user.",
