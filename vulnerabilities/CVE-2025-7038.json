  "Description": "The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass due to insufficient identity verification within the steps__load_step route of the latepoint_route_call AJAX endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.94. The endpoint reads the client-supplied customer email and related customer fields before invoking the internal login handler without verifying login status, capability checks, or a valid AJAX nonce. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log into any customer\u2019s account.",
