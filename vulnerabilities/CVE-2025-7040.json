  "Description": "The Cloud SAML SSO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'set_organization_settings' action of the csso_handle_actions() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.19. The handler reads client-supplied POST parameters for organization settings and passes them directly to update_option() without any check of the user\u2019s capabilities or a CSRF nonce. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change critical configuration (including toggling signing and encryption), potentially breaking the SSO flow and causing a denial-of-service.",
