  "Description": "The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.94. This is due to missing nonce validation on the change_password() function of its customer_cabinet__change_password AJAX route. The plugin hooks this endpoint via wp_ajax and wp_ajax_nopriv but does not verify a nonce or user capability before resetting the user\u2019s password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who trick a logged-in customer (or, with \u201cWP users as customers\u201d enabled, an administrator) into visiting a malicious link to take over their account.",
