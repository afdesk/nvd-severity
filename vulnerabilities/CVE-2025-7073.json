  "Description": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability in Bitdefender Total Security 27.0.46.231 allows low-privileged attackers to elevate privileges. The issue arises from bdservicehost.exe\u00a0deleting files from a user-writable directory (C:\\ProgramData\\Atc\\Feedback) without proper symbolic link validation, enabling arbitrary file deletion. This issue is chained with a file copy operation during network events and a filter driver bypass via DLL injection to achieve arbitrary file copy and code execution as elevated user.",
