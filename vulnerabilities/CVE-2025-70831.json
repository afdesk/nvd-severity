  "Description": "A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was found in Smanga 3.2.7 in the /php/path/rescan.php interface. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the mediaId parameter before using it in a system shell command. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands, leading to complete server compromise.",
