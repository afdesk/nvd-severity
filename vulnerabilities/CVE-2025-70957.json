  "Description": "A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in the TON Lite Server before v2024.09. The vulnerability arises from the handling of external arguments passed to locally executed \"get methods.\" An attacker can inject a constructed Continuation object (an internal TVM type) that is normally restricted within the VM. When the TVM executes this malicious continuation, it consumes excessive CPU resources while accruing disproportionately low virtual gas costs. This \"free\" computation allows an attacker to monopolize the Lite Server's processing power, significantly reducing its throughput and causing a denial of service for legitimate users acting through the gateway.",
