  "Description": "danny-avila/librechat is affected by an authorization bypass vulnerability due to improper access control checks. The `checkAccess` function in `api/server/middleware/roles/access.js` uses `permissions.some()` to validate permissions, which incorrectly grants access if only one of multiple required permissions is present. This allows users with the 'USER' role to create agents despite having `CREATE: false` permission, as the check for `['USE', 'CREATE']` passes with just `USE: true`. This vulnerability affects other permission checks as well, such as `PROMPTS`. The issue is present in all versions prior to the fix.",
