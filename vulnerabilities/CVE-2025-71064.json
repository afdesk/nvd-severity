  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: using the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources\n\nCurrently, hdev->htqp is allocated using hdev->num_tqps, and kinfo->tqp\nis allocated using kinfo->num_tqps. However, kinfo->num_tqps is set to\nmin(new_tqps, hdev->num_tqps);  Therefore, kinfo->num_tqps may be smaller\nthan hdev->num_tqps, which causes some hdev->htqp[i] to remain\nuninitialized in hclgevf_knic_setup().\n\nThus, this patch allocates hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp using hdev->num_tqps,\nensuring that the lengths of hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp are consistent\nand that all elements are properly initialized.",
