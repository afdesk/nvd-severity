  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nntfs: set dummy blocksize to read boot_block when mounting\n\nWhen mounting, sb->s_blocksize is used to read the boot_block without\nbeing defined or validated. Set a dummy blocksize before attempting to\nread the boot_block.\n\nThe issue can be triggered with the following syz reproducer:\n\n  mkdirat(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000080)='./file1\\x00', 0x0)\n  r4 = openat$nullb(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000040), 0x121403, 0x0)\n  ioctl$FS_IOC_SETFLAGS(r4, 0x40081271, &(0x7f0000000980)=0x4000)\n  mount(&(0x7f0000000140)=@nullb, &(0x7f0000000040)='./cgroup\\x00',\n        &(0x7f0000000000)='ntfs3\\x00', 0x2208004, 0x0)\n  syz_clone(0x88200200, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n\nHere, the ioctl sets the bdev block size to 16384. During mount,\nget_tree_bdev_flags() calls sb_set_blocksize(sb, block_size(bdev)),\nbut since block_size(bdev) > PAGE_SIZE, sb_set_blocksize() leaves\nsb->s_blocksize at zero.\n\nLater, ntfs_init_from_boot() attempts to read the boot_block while\nsb->s_blocksize is still zero, which triggers the bug.\n\n[almaz.alexandrovich@paragon-software.com: changed comment style, added\nreturn value handling]",
