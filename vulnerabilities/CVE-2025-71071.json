  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/mediatek: fix use-after-free on probe deferral\n\nThe driver is dropping the references taken to the larb devices during\nprobe after successful lookup as well as on errors. This can\npotentially lead to a use-after-free in case a larb device has not yet\nbeen bound to its driver so that the iommu driver probe defers.\n\nFix this by keeping the references as expected while the iommu driver is\nbound.",
