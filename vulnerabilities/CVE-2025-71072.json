  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nshmem: fix recovery on rename failures\n\nmaple_tree insertions can fail if we are seriously short on memory;\nsimple_offset_rename() does not recover well if it runs into that.\nThe same goes for simple_offset_rename_exchange().\n\nMoreover, shmem_whiteout() expects that if it succeeds, the caller will\nprogress to d_move(), i.e. that shmem_rename2() won't fail past the\nsuccessful call of shmem_whiteout().\n\nNot hard to fix, fortunately - mtree_store() can't fail if the index we\nare trying to store into is already present in the tree as a singleton.\n\nFor simple_offset_rename_exchange() that's enough - we just need to be\ncareful about the order of operations.\n\nFor simple_offset_rename() solution is to preinsert the target into the\ntree for new_dir; the rest can be done without any potentially failing\noperations.\n\nThat preinsertion has to be done in shmem_rename2() rather than in\nsimple_offset_rename() itself - otherwise we'd need to deal with the\npossibility of failure after successful shmem_whiteout().",
