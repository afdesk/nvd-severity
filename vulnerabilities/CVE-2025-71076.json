  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/oa: Limit num_syncs to prevent oversized allocations\n\nThe OA open parameters did not validate num_syncs, allowing\nuserspace to pass arbitrarily large values, potentially\nleading to excessive allocations.\n\nAdd check to ensure that num_syncs does not exceed DRM_XE_MAX_SYNCS,\nreturning -EINVAL when the limit is violated.\n\nv2: use XE_IOCTL_DBG() and drop duplicated check. (Ashutosh)\n\n(cherry picked from commit e057b2d2b8d815df3858a87dffafa2af37e5945b)",
