  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: fix a BUG in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT\n\nOn PREEMPT_RT kernels, after rt6_get_pcpu_route() returns NULL, the\ncurrent task can be preempted. Another task running on the same CPU\nmay then execute rt6_make_pcpu_route() and successfully install a\npcpu_rt entry. When the first task resumes execution, its cmpxchg()\nin rt6_make_pcpu_route() will fail because rt6i_pcpu is no longer\nNULL, triggering the BUG_ON(prev). It's easy to reproduce it by adding\nmdelay() after rt6_get_pcpu_route().\n\nUsing preempt_disable/enable is not appropriate here because\nip6_rt_pcpu_alloc() may sleep.\n\nFix this by handling the cmpxchg() failure gracefully on PREEMPT_RT:\nfree our allocation and return the existing pcpu_rt installed by\nanother task. The BUG_ON is replaced by WARN_ON_ONCE for non-PREEMPT_RT\nkernels where such races should not occur.",
