  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: stm32: sai: fix OF node leak on probe\n\nThe reference taken to the sync provider OF node when probing the\nplatform device is currently only dropped if the set_sync() callback\nfails during DAI probe.\n\nMake sure to drop the reference on platform probe failures (e.g. probe\ndeferral) and on driver unbind.\n\nThis also avoids a potential use-after-free in case the DAI is ever\nreprobed without first rebinding the platform driver.",
