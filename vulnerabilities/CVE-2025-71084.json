This leaks a refcount and\ntriggers a WARN:\n\n   GID entry ref leak for dev syz1 index 2 ref=573\n   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 655 at drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:809 release_gid_table drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:806 [inline]\n   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 655 at drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:809 gid_table_release_one+0x284/0x3cc drivers/infiniband/core/cache.c:886\n\nDestroy the ah_attr after canceling the work, it is safe to call this\ntwice.",
