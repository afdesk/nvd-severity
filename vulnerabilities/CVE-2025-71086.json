  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: rose: fix invalid array index in rose_kill_by_device()\n\nrose_kill_by_device() collects sockets into a local array[] and then\niterates over them to disconnect sockets bound to a device being brought\ndown.\n\nThe loop mistakenly indexes array[cnt] instead of array[i]. For cnt <\nARRAY_SIZE(array), this reads an uninitialized entry; for cnt ==\nARRAY_SIZE(array), it is an out-of-bounds read. Either case can lead to\nan invalid socket pointer dereference and also leaks references taken\nvia sock_hold().\n\nFix the index to use i.",
