  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/bnxt_re: Fix OOB write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats()\n\nCommit ef56081d1864 (\"RDMA/bnxt_re: RoCE related hardware counters\nupdate\") added three new counters and placed them after\nBNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR.\n\nBNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR acts as a boundary marker for allocating hardware\nstatistics with different num_counters values on chip_gen_p5_p7 devices.\n\nAs a result, BNXT_RE_NUM_STD_COUNTERS are used when allocating\nhw_stats, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in\nbnxt_re_copy_err_stats().\n\nThe counters BNXT_RE_REQ_CQE_ERROR, BNXT_RE_RESP_CQE_ERROR, and\nBNXT_RE_RESP_REMOTE_ACCESS_ERRS are applicable to generic hardware, not\nonly p5/p7 devices.\n\nFix this by moving these counters before BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR so they\nare included in the generic counter set.",
