  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/oa: Fix potential UAF in xe_oa_add_config_ioctl()\n\nIn xe_oa_add_config_ioctl(), we accessed oa_config->id after dropping\nmetrics_lock. Since this lock protects the lifetime of oa_config, an\nattacker could guess the id and call xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl() with\nperfect timing, freeing oa_config before we dereference it, leading to\na potential use-after-free.\n\nFix this by caching the id in a local variable while holding the lock.\n\nv2: (Matt A)\n- Dropped mutex_unlock(&oa->metrics_lock) ordering change from\n  xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl()\n\n(cherry picked from commit 28aeaed130e8e587fd1b73b6d66ca41ccc5a1a31)",
