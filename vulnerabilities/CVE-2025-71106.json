  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: PM: Fix reverse check in filesystems_freeze_callback()\n\nThe freeze_all_ptr check in filesystems_freeze_callback() introduced by\ncommit a3f8f8662771 (\"power: always freeze efivarfs\") is reverse which\nquite confusingly causes all file systems to be frozen when\nfilesystem_freeze_enabled is false.\n\nOn my systems it causes the WARN_ON_ONCE() in __set_task_frozen() to\ntrigger, most likely due to an attempt to freeze a file system that is\nnot ready for that.\n\nAdd a logical negation to the check in question to reverse it as\nappropriate.",
