  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nMIPS: ftrace: Fix memory corruption when kernel is located beyond 32 bits\n\nSince commit e424054000878 (\"MIPS: Tracing: Reduce the overhead of\ndynamic Function Tracer\"), the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly has been used,\nand this macro can generate more than 2 instructions. At the same\ntime, the code in ftrace assumes that no more than 2 instructions can\nbe generated, which is why it stores them in an int[2] array. However,\nas previously noted, the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly (and now UASM_i_LA)\ncauses a buffer overflow when _mcount is beyond 32 bits. This leads to\ncorruption of the variables located in the __read_mostly section.\n\nThis corruption was observed because the variable\n__cpu_primary_thread_mask was corrupted, causing a hang very early\nduring boot.\n\nThis fix prevents the corruption by avoiding the generation of\ninstructions if they could exceed 2 instructions in\nlength. Fortunately, insn_la_mcount is only used if the instrumented\ncode is located outside the kernel code section, so dynamic ftrace can\nstill be used, albeit in a more limited scope. This is still\npreferable to corrupting memory and/or crashing the kernel.",
