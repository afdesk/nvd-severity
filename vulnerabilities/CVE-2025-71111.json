  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (w83791d) Convert macros to functions to avoid TOCTOU\n\nThe macro FAN_FROM_REG evaluates its arguments multiple times. When used\nin lockless contexts involving shared driver data, this leads to\nTime-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions, potentially\ncausing divide-by-zero errors.\n\nConvert the macro to a static function. This guarantees that arguments\nare evaluated only once (pass-by-value), preventing the race\nconditions.\n\nAdditionally, in store_fan_div, move the calculation of the minimum\nlimit inside the update lock. This ensures that the read-modify-write\nsequence operates on consistent data.\n\nAdhere to the principle of minimal changes by only converting macros\nthat evaluate arguments multiple times and are used in lockless\ncontexts.",
