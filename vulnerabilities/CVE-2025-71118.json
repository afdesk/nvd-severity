  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPICA: Avoid walking the Namespace if start_node is NULL\n\nAlthough commit 0c9992315e73 (\"ACPICA: Avoid walking the ACPI Namespace\nif it is not there\") fixed the situation when both start_node and\nacpi_gbl_root_node are NULL, the Linux kernel mainline now still crashed\non Honor Magicbook 14 Pro [1].\n\nThat happens due to the access to the member of parent_node in\nacpi_ns_get_next_node().  The NULL pointer dereference will always\nhappen, no matter whether or not the start_node is equal to\nACPI_ROOT_OBJECT, so move the check of start_node being NULL\nout of the if block.\n\nUnfortunately, all the attempts to contact Honor have failed, they\nrefused to provide any technical support for Linux.\n\nThe bad DSDT table's dump could be found on GitHub [2].\n\nDMI: HONOR FMB-P/FMB-P-PCB, BIOS 1.13 05/08/2025\n\n[ rjw: Subject adjustment, changelog edits ]",
