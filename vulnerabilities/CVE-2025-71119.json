  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/kexec: Enable SMT before waking offline CPUs\n\nIf SMT is disabled or a partial SMT state is enabled, when a new kernel\nimage is loaded for kexec, on reboot the following warning is observed:\n\nkexec: Waking offline cpu 228.\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9062 at arch/powerpc/kexec/core_64.c:223 kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1b0/0x1bc\n[snip]\n NIP kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1b0/0x1bc\n LR  kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1a0/0x1bc\n Call Trace:\n  kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1a0/0x1bc (unreliable)\n  default_machine_kexec+0x160/0x19c\n  machine_kexec+0x80/0x88\n  kernel_kexec+0xd0/0x118\n  __do_sys_reboot+0x210/0x2c4\n  system_call_exception+0x124/0x320\n  system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec\n\nThis occurs as add_cpu() fails due to cpu_bootable() returning false for\nCPUs that fail the cpu_smt_thread_allowed() check or non primary\nthreads if SMT is disabled.\n\nFix the issue by enabling SMT and resetting the number of SMT threads to\nthe number of threads per core, before attempting to wake up all present\nCPUs.",
