  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSUNRPC: svcauth_gss: avoid NULL deref on zero length gss_token in gss_read_proxy_verf\n\nA zero length gss_token results in pages == 0 and in_token->pages[0]\nis NULL. The code unconditionally evaluates\npage_address(in_token->pages[0]) for the initial memcpy, which can\ndereference NULL even when the copy length is 0. Guard the first\nmemcpy so it only runs when length > 0.",
