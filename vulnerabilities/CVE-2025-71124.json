  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/a6xx: move preempt_prepare_postamble after error check\n\nMove the call to preempt_prepare_postamble() after verifying that\npreempt_postamble_ptr is valid. If preempt_postamble_ptr is NULL,\ndereferencing it in preempt_prepare_postamble() would lead to a crash.\n\nThis change avoids calling the preparation function when the\npostamble allocation has failed, preventing potential NULL pointer\ndereference and ensuring proper error handling.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/687659/",
