  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/gem: Zero-initialize the eb.vma array in i915_gem_do_execbuffer\n\nInitialize the eb.vma array with values of 0 when the eb structure is\nfirst set up. In particular, this sets the eb->vma[i].vma pointers to\nNULL, simplifying cleanup and getting rid of the bug described below.\n\nDuring the execution of eb_lookup_vmas(), the eb->vma array is\nsuccessively filled up with struct eb_vma objects. This process includes\ncalling eb_add_vma(), which might fail; however, even in the event of\nfailure, eb->vma[i].vma is set for the currently processed buffer.\n\nIf eb_add_vma() fails, eb_lookup_vmas() returns with an error, which\nprompts a call to eb_release_vmas() to clean up the mess. Since\neb_lookup_vmas() might fail during processing any (possibly not first)\nbuffer, eb_release_vmas() checks whether a buffer's vma is NULL to know\nat what point did the lookup function fail.\n\nIn eb_lookup_vmas(), eb->vma[i].vma is set to NULL if either the helper\nfunction eb_lookup_vma() or eb_validate_vma() fails. eb->vma[i+1].vma is\nset to NULL in case i915_gem_object_userptr_submit_init() fails; the\ncurrent one needs to be cleaned up by eb_release_vmas() at this point,\nso the next one is set. If eb_add_vma() fails, neither the current nor\nthe next vma is set to NULL, which is a source of a NULL deref bug\ndescribed in the issue linked in the Closes tag.\n\nWhen entering eb_lookup_vmas(), the vma pointers are set to the slab\npoison value, instead of NULL. This doesn't matter for the actual\nlookup, since it gets overwritten anyway, however the eb_release_vmas()\nfunction only recognizes NULL as the stopping value, hence the pointers\nare being set to NULL as they go in case of intermediate failure. This\npatch changes the approach to filling them all with NULL at the start\ninstead, rather than handling that manually during failure.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 08889b706d4f0b8d2352b7ca29c2d8df4d0787cd)",
