  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: seqiv - Do not use req->iv after crypto_aead_encrypt\n\nAs soon as crypto_aead_encrypt is called, the underlying request\nmay be freed by an asynchronous completion.  Thus dereferencing\nreq->iv after it returns is invalid.\n\nInstead of checking req->iv against info, create a new variable\nunaligned_info and use it for that purpose instead.",
