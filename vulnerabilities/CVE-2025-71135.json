  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid5: fix possible null-pointer dereferences in raid5_store_group_thread_cnt()\n\nThe variable mddev->private is first assigned to conf and then checked:\n\n  conf = mddev->private;\n  if (!conf) ...\n\nIf conf is NULL, then mddev->private is also NULL. In this case,\nnull-pointer dereferences can occur when calling raid5_quiesce():\n\n  raid5_quiesce(mddev, true);\n  raid5_quiesce(mddev, false);\n\nsince mddev->private is assigned to conf again in raid5_quiesce(), and conf\nis dereferenced in several places, for example:\n\n  conf->quiesce = 0;\n  wake_up(&conf->wait_for_quiescent);\n\nTo fix this issue, the function should unlock mddev and return before\ninvoking raid5_quiesce() when conf is NULL, following the existing pattern\nin raid5_change_consistency_policy().",
