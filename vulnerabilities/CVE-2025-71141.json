  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/tilcdc: Fix removal actions in case of failed probe\n\nThe drm_kms_helper_poll_fini() and drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() helpers\nshould only be called when the device has been successfully registered.\nCurrently, these functions are called unconditionally in tilcdc_fini(),\nwhich causes warnings during probe deferral scenarios.\n\n[    7.972317] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 23 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic_state_helper.c:175 drm_atomic_helper_crtc_duplicate_state+0x60/0x68\n...\n[    8.005820]  drm_atomic_helper_crtc_duplicate_state from drm_atomic_get_crtc_state+0x68/0x108\n[    8.005858]  drm_atomic_get_crtc_state from drm_atomic_helper_disable_all+0x90/0x1c8\n[    8.005885]  drm_atomic_helper_disable_all from drm_atomic_helper_shutdown+0x90/0x144\n[    8.005911]  drm_atomic_helper_shutdown from tilcdc_fini+0x68/0xf8 [tilcdc]\n[    8.005957]  tilcdc_fini [tilcdc] from tilcdc_pdev_probe+0xb0/0x6d4 [tilcdc]\n\nFix this by rewriting the failed probe cleanup path using the standard\ngoto error handling pattern, which ensures that cleanup functions are\nonly called on successfully initialized resources. Additionally, remove\nthe now-unnecessary is_registered flag.",
