  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: samsung: exynos-clkout: Assign .num before accessing .hws\n\nCommit f316cdff8d67 (\"clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with\n__counted_by\") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'\nwith __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer (UBSAN_BOUNDS)\nabout the number of elements in .hws[], so that it can warn when .hws[]\nis accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by\nmember must be initialized with the number of elements before the first\narray access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access\nprior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This\noccurs in exynos_clkout_probe() due to .num being assigned after .hws[]\nhas been accessed:\n\n  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/samsung/clk-exynos-clkout.c:178:18\n  index 0 is out of range for type 'clk_hw *[*]'\n\nMove the .num initialization to before the first access of .hws[],\nclearing up the warning.",
