  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: phy: isp1301: fix non-OF device reference imbalance\n\nA recent change fixing a device reference leak in a UDC driver\nintroduced a potential use-after-free in the non-OF case as the\nisp1301_get_client() helper only increases the reference count for the\nreturned I2C device in the OF case.\n\nIncrement the reference count also for non-OF so that the caller can\ndecrement it unconditionally.\n\nNote that this is inherently racy just as using the returned I2C device\nis since nothing is preventing the PHY driver from being unbound while\nin use.",
