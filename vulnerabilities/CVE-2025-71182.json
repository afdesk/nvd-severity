  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: j1939: make j1939_session_activate() fail if device is no longer registered\n\nsyzbot is still reporting\n\n  unregister_netdevice: waiting for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2\n\neven after commit 93a27b5891b8 (\"can: j1939: add missing calls in\nNETDEV_UNREGISTER notification handler\") was added. A debug printk() patch\nfound that j1939_session_activate() can succeed even after\nj1939_cancel_active_session() from j1939_netdev_notify(NETDEV_UNREGISTER)\nhas completed.\n\nSince j1939_cancel_active_session() is processed with the session list lock\nheld, checking ndev->reg_state in j1939_session_activate() with the session\nlist lock held can reliably close the race window.",
