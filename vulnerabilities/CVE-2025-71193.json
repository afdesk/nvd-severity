  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: qcom-qusb2: Fix NULL pointer dereference on early suspend\n\nEnabling runtime PM before attaching the QPHY instance as driver data\ncan lead to a NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM callbacks that\nexpect valid driver data. There is a small window where the suspend\ncallback may run after PM runtime enabling and before runtime forbid.\nThis causes a sporadic crash during boot:\n\n```\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000a1\n[...]\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 11 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted 6.16.7+ #116 PREEMPT\nWorkqueue: pm pm_runtime_work\npstate: 20000005 (nzCv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\npc : qusb2_phy_runtime_suspend+0x14/0x1e0 [phy_qcom_qusb2]\nlr : pm_generic_runtime_suspend+0x2c/0x44\n[...]\n```\n\nAttach the QPHY instance as driver data before enabling runtime PM to\nprevent NULL pointer dereference in runtime PM callbacks.\n\nReorder pm_runtime_enable() and pm_runtime_forbid() to prevent a\nshort window where an unnecessary runtime suspend can occur.\n\nUse the devres-managed version to ensure PM runtime is symmetrically\ndisabled during driver removal for proper cleanup.",
