  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: Fix potential use-after-free in sama5d2_adc driver\n\nat91_adc_interrupt can call at91_adc_touch_data_handler function\nto start the work by schedule_work(&st->touch_st.workq).\n\nIf we remove the module which will call at91_adc_remove to\nmake cleanup, it will free indio_dev through iio_device_unregister but\nquite a bit later. While the work mentioned above will be used. The\nsequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                      CPU1\n\n                                     | at91_adc_workq_handler\nat91_adc_remove                      |\niio_device_unregister(indio_dev)     |\n//free indio_dev a bit later         |\n                                     | iio_push_to_buffers(indio_dev)\n                                     | //use indio_dev\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with\nthe cleanup in at91_adc_remove.",
