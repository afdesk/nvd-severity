  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: Sanitize syscall table indexing under speculation\n\nThe syscall number is a user-controlled value used to index into the\nsyscall table. Use array_index_nospec() to clamp this value after the\nbounds check to prevent speculative out-of-bounds access and subsequent\ndata leakage via cache side channels.",
