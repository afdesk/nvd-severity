  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfs: ensure sb->s_fs_info is always cleaned up\n\nWhen hfs was converted to the new mount api a bug was introduced by\nchanging the allocation pattern of sb->s_fs_info. If setup_bdev_super()\nfails after a new superblock has been allocated by sget_fc(), but before\nhfs_fill_super() takes ownership of the filesystem-specific s_fs_info\ndata it was leaked.\n\nFix this by freeing sb->s_fs_info in hfs_kill_super().",
