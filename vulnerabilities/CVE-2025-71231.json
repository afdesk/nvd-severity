  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: iaa - Fix out-of-bounds index in find_empty_iaa_compression_mode\n\nThe local variable 'i' is initialized with -EINVAL, but the for loop\nimmediately overwrites it and -EINVAL is never returned.\n\nIf no empty compression mode can be found, the function would return the\nout-of-bounds index IAA_COMP_MODES_MAX, which would cause an invalid\narray access in add_iaa_compression_mode().\n\nFix both issues by returning either a valid index or -EINVAL.",
