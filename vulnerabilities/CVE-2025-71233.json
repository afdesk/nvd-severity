  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: endpoint: Avoid creating sub-groups asynchronously\n\nThe asynchronous creation of sub-groups by a delayed work could lead to a\nNULL pointer dereference when the driver directory is removed before the\nwork completes.\n\nThe crash can be easily reproduced with the following commands:\n\n  # cd /sys/kernel/config/pci_ep/functions/pci_epf_test\n  # for i in {1..20}; do mkdir test && rmdir test; done\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000088\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   configfs_register_group+0x3d/0x190\n   pci_epf_cfs_work+0x41/0x110\n   process_one_work+0x18f/0x350\n   worker_thread+0x25a/0x3a0\n\nFix this issue by using configfs_add_default_group() API which does not\nhave the deadlock problem as configfs_register_group() and does not require\nthe delayed work handler.\n\n[mani: slightly reworded the description and added stable list]",
