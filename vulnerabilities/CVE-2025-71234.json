  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtl8xxxu: fix slab-out-of-bounds in rtl8xxxu_sta_add\n\nThe driver does not set hw->sta_data_size, which causes mac80211 to\nallocate insufficient space for driver private station data in\n__sta_info_alloc(). When rtl8xxxu_sta_add() accesses members of\nstruct rtl8xxxu_sta_info through sta->drv_priv, this results in a\nslab-out-of-bounds write.\n\nKASAN report on RISC-V (VisionFive 2) with RTL8192EU adapter:\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in rtl8xxxu_sta_add+0x31c/0x346\n  Write of size 8 at addr ffffffd6d3e9ae88 by task kworker/u16:0/12\n\nSet hw->sta_data_size to sizeof(struct rtl8xxxu_sta_info) during\nprobe, similar to how hw->vif_data_size is configured. This ensures\nmac80211 allocates sufficient space for the driver's per-station\nprivate data.\n\nTested on StarFive VisionFive 2 v1.2A board.",
