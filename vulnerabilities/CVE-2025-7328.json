  "Description": "Multiple Broken Authentication security issues exist in the affected product. The security issues are due to missing authentication checks on critical functions. These could result in potential denial-of-service, admin account takeover, or NAT rule modifications. Devices would no longer be able to communicate through NATR as a result of denial-of-service or NAT rule modifications. NAT rule modification could also result in device communication to incorrect endpoints. Admin account takeover could allow modification of configuration and require physical access to restore.",
