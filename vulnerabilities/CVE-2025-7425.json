  "Description": "A flaw was found in libxslt where the attribute type, atype, flags are modified in a way that corrupts internal memory management. When XSLT functions, such as the key() process, result in tree fragments, this corruption prevents the proper cleanup of ID attributes. As a result, the system may access freed memory, causing crashes or enabling attackers to trigger heap corruption.",
