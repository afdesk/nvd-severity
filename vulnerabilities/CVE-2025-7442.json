  "Description": "The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via several parameters in the MJ_gmgt_delete_class_limit_for_member, MJ_gmgt_get_yearly_income_expense, MJ_gmgt_get_monthly_income_expense, MJ_gmgt_add_class_limit, MJ_gmgt_view_meeting_detail, and MJ_gmgt_create_meeting functions in all versions up to 67.8.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
