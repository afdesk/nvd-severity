  "Description": "The Lazy Load for Videos plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via its lazy\u2011loading handlers in all versions up to, and including, 2.18.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The plugin\u2019s JavaScript registration handlers read the client\u2011supplied 'data-video-title' and 'href' attributes, decode HTML entities by default, and pass them directly into DOM sinks without any escaping or validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
