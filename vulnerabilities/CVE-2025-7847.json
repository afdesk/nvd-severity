  "Description": "The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the rest_simpleFileUpload() function in versions 2.9.3 and 2.9.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server when the REST API is enabled, which may make remote code execution possible.",
