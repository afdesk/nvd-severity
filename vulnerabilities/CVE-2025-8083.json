  "Description": "The  Preset configuration https://v2.vuetifyjs.com/en/features/presets \u00a0feature of Vuetify is vulnerable to  Prototype Pollution https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Prototype_Pollution_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html \u00a0due to the internal 'mergeDeep' utility function used to merge options with defaults.\u00a0Using a specially-crafted, malicious preset can result in polluting all JavaScript objects with arbitrary properties, which can further negatively affect all aspects of the application's behavior. This can lead to a wide range of security issues, including resource exhaustion/denial of service or unauthorized access to data.\n\nIf the application utilizes\u00a0Server-Side Rendering (SSR), this vulnerability could affect the whole server process.\n\nThis issue affects Vuetify versions greater than or equal to 2.2.0-beta.2\u00a0and less than 3.0.0-alpha.10.\n\nNote:\nVersion 2.x of Vuetify is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue.
