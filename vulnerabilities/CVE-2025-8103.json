  "Description": "The WPeMatico RSS Feed Fetcher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.7. This is due to missing nonce validation in the handle_feedback_submission() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
