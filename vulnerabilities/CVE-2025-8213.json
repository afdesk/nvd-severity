  "Description": "The NinjaScanner \u2013 Virus & Malware scan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'nscan_ajax_quarantine' and 'nscan_quarantine_select' functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, including files outside the WordPress root directory.",
