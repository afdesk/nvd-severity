  "Description": "The Catalog Importer, Scraper & Crawler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP code injection in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.4. This is due to reliance on a guessable numeric token (e.g. ?key= 900001705) without proper authentication, combined with the unsafe use of eval() on user-supplied input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server via a forged request granted they can guess or brute-force the numeric key.",
