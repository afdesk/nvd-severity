  "Description": "Alpine iLX-507 vCard Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Alpine iLX-507 devices. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of vCard data. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-26324.",
