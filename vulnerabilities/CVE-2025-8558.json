  "Description": "Insider Threat Management (ITM) Server\u00a0versions prior to 7.17.2\u00a0contain an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows unauthenticated users on an adjacent network to perform agent unregistration when the number of registered agents exceeds the licensed limit. Successful exploitation prevents the server from receiving new events from affected agents, resulting in a partial loss of integrity and availability with no impact to confidentiality.",
