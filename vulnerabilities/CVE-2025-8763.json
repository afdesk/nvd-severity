This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /etc/strongswan.conf of the component strongSwan. The manipulation of the argument i_dont_care_about_security_and_use_aggressive_mode_psk leads to missing encryption of sensitive data. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
