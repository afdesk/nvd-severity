  "Description": "In danny-avila/librechat version 0.7.9, there is an insecure API design issue in the 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) flow. The system allows users to disable 2FA without requiring a valid OTP or backup code, bypassing the intended verification process. This vulnerability occurs because the backend does not properly validate the OTP or backup code when the API endpoint '/api/auth/2fa/disable' is directly accessed. This flaw can be exploited by authenticated users to weaken the security of their own accounts, although it does not lead to full account compromise.",
