  "Description": "The Graphina - Elementor Charts and Graphs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple chart widget parameters in version 3.1.3 and below. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as chart categories, titles, and tooltip settings. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
