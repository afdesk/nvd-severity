  "Description": "The OceanWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions 4.0.9 to 4.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the oceanwp_notice_button_click() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install the Ocean Extra plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
