  "Description": "The User Profile Builder \u2013 Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'gdpr_communication_preferences[]' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.14.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when the GDPR Communication Preferences module is enabled and at least one GDPR Communication Preferences field has been added to the edit profile form.",
