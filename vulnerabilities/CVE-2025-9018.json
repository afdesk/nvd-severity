  "Description": "The Time Tracker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'tt_update_table_function' and 'tt_delete_record_function' functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update options such as user registration and default role, allowing anyone to register as an Administrator, and to delete limited data from the database.",
