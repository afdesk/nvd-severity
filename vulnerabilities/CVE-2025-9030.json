  "Description": "The Majestic Before After Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'before_label' and 'after_label' parameters in versions less than, or equal to, 2.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
