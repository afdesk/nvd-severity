  "Description": "A flaw has been found in libretro RetroArch 1.18.0/1.19.0/1.20.0. This affects the function filestream_vscanf of the file libretro-common/streams/file_stream.c. This manipulation causes out-of-bounds read. The attack needs to be launched locally. Upgrading to version 1.21.0 mitigates this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
