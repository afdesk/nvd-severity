  "Description": "The RestroPress \u2013 Online Food Ordering System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions 3.0.0 to 3.1.9.2. This is due to the plugin exposing user private tokens and API data via the /wp-json/wp/v2/users REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to forge JWT tokens for other users, including administrators, and authenticate as them.",
