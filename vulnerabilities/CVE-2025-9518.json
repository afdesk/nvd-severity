  "Description": "The atec Debug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation on the 'debug_path' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.22. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
