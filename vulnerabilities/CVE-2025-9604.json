  "Description": "A vulnerability was identified in coze-studio up to 0.2.4. The impacted element is an unknown function of the file backend/domain/plugin/encrypt/aes.go. The manipulation of the argument AuthSecretKey/StateSecretKey/OAuthTokenSecretKey leads to use of hard-coded cryptographic key\r . It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The attack is considered to have high complexity. The exploitability is regarded as difficult. To fix this issue, it is recommended to deploy a patch. The vendor replied to the GitHub issue (translated from simplified Chinese): \"For scenarios requiring encryption, we will implement user-defined key management through configuration and optimize the use of encryption tools, such as random salt.\"",
