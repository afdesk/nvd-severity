  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the PCI Express (PCIe) Integrity and Data Encryption (IDE) specification, where insufficient guidance on re-keying and stream flushing during device rebinding may allow stale write transactions from a previous security context to be processed in a new one. This can lead to unintended data access across trusted domains, compromising confidentiality and integrity.",
