  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in the Kubernetes C# client where the certificate validation logic accepts properly constructed certificates from any Certificate Authority (CA) without properly verifying the trust chain. This flaw allows a malicious actor to present a forged certificate and potentially intercept or manipulate communication with the Kubernetes API server, leading to possible man-in-the-middle attacks and API impersonation.",
