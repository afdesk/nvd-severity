  "Description": "The Keras Model.load_model\u00a0method can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, even with safe_mode=True.\n\nOne can create a specially crafted .h5/.hdf5\u00a0model archive that, when loaded via Model.load_model, will trigger arbitrary code to be executed.\n\nThis is achieved by crafting a special .h5\u00a0archive file that uses the Lambda\u00a0layer feature of keras which allows arbitrary Python code in the form of pickled code. The vulnerability comes from the fact that the safe_mode=True\u00a0option is not honored when reading .h5\u00a0archives.\n\nNote that the .h5/.hdf5\u00a0format is a legacy format supported by Keras 3 for backwards compatibility.",
