  "Description": "The Internal Links Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the link deletion functionality in the process_bulk_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete SEO links via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
