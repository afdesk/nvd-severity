  "Description": "Value provided in one of POST parameters sent during the process of logging in to Times Software E-Payroll is not sanitized properly, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform DoS attacks. SQL injection attacks might also be feasible, although so far creating a working exploit has been prevented probably by backend filtering mechanisms.\nAdditionally, command injection attempts cause the application to return extensive error messages disclosing some information about the internal infrastructure.\u00a0\nPatching status is unknown because the vendor has not replied to messages sent by the CNA.",
