  "Description": "GALAYOU G2 cameras stream video output via RTSP streams. By default these streams are protected by randomly generated credentials. However these credentials are not required to access the stream. Changing these values does not change camera's behavior.\n\nThe vendor did not respond in any way. Only version\u00a011.100001.01.28 was tested, other versions might also be vulnerable.",
