  "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-adjacent attacker sending a specifically malformed ICMP packet to cause an FPC to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n\n\nWhen an ICMP packet is received with a specifically malformed IP header value, the FPC receiving the packet crashes and restarts. Due to the specific type of malformed packet, adjacent upstream routers would not forward the packet, limiting the attack surface to adjacent networks.\n\nThis issue only affects ICMPv4. ICMPv6 is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S7,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2.",
