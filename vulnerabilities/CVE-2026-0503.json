  "Description": "Due to missing authorization check in the SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC) and SAP S/4HANA (SAP EHS Management), an attacker could extract hardcoded clear-text credentials and bypass the password authentication check by manipulating user parameters. Upon successful exploitation, the attacker can access, modify or delete certain change pointer information within EHS objects in the application which might further affect the subsequent systems. This vulnerability leads to a low impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application with no affect on the availability.",
