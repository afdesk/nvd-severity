  "Description": "Multiple D-Link DSL/DIR/DNS devices contain an authentication bypass and improper access control vulnerability in the dnscfg.cgi endpoint that allows an unauthenticated attacker to access DNS configuration functionality. By directly requesting this endpoint, an attacker can modify the device\u2019s DNS settings without valid credentials, enabling DNS hijacking (\u201cDNSChanger\u201d) attacks that redirect user traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure. In 2019, D-Link reported that this behavior was leveraged by the \"GhostDNS\" malware ecosystem targeting consumer and carrier routers. All impacted products were subsequently designated end-of-life/end-of-service, and no longer receive security updates.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-11-27 (UTC).",
