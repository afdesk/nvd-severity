  "Description": "Moxa Arm-based industrial computers running Moxa Industrial Linux Secure use a device-unique bootloader password provided on the device. An attacker with physical access\u00a0to the device could use this information to access the bootloader menu via a serial interface. \u00a0Access to the bootloader menu does not allow full system takeover or privilege escalation. The bootloader enforces digital signature verification and only permits flashing of Moxa-signed images. As a result, an attacker cannot install malicious firmware or execute arbitrary code. The primary impact is limited to a potential temporary denial-of-service condition\u00a0if a valid image is reflashed. Remote exploitation is not possible.",
