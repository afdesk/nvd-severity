  "Description": "A flaw was found in libsoup\u2019s WebSocket frame processing when handling incoming messages. If a non-default configuration is used where the maximum incoming payload size is unset, the library may read memory outside the intended bounds. This can cause unintended memory exposure or a crash. Applications using libsoup\u2019s WebSocket support with this configuration may be impacted.",
