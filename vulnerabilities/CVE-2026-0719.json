  "Description": "A flaw was found in libsoup's NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication module. When NTLM authentication is enabled, a local attacker can exploit a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the md4sum() function. This allows the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, which may result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected application.",
