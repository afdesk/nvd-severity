  "Description": "The Short Link plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'short_link_post_title' and 'short_link_page_title' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.",
