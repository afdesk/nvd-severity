  "Description": "The Templately plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.8. This is due to inadequate input validation in the `save_template_to_file()` function where user-controlled parameters like `session_id`, `content_id`, and `ai_page_ids` are used to construct file paths without proper sanitization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary `.ai.json` files to locations within the uploads directory.",
