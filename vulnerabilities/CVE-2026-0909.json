  "Description": "The WP ULike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.3.1. This is due to the `wp_ulike_delete_history_api` AJAX action not verifying that the log entry being deleted belongs to the current user. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above (granted the 'stats' capability is assigned to their role), to delete arbitrary log entries belonging to other users via the 'id' parameter.",
