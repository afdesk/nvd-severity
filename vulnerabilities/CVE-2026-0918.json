  "Description": "The Tapo C220 v1 and C520WS v2 cameras\u2019 HTTP service does not safely handle POST requests containing an excessively large Content-Length header. The resulting failed memory allocation triggers a NULL pointer dereference, causing the main service process to crash.\u00a0An unauthenticated attacker can repeatedly crash the service, causing temporary denial of service. The device restarts automatically, and repeated requests can keep it unavailable.",
