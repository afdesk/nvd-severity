  "Description": "The LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Administrative User Creation in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.6.3. This is due to the 'ajax_register_handle' function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'lakit_bkrole' parameter during registration and gain administrator access to the site.",
