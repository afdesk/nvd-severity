  "Description": "The Spectra Gutenberg Blocks \u2013 Website Builder for the Block Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.19.17. This is due to the plugin failing to check `post_password_required()` before rendering post excerpts in the `render_excerpt()` function and the `uagb_get_excerpt()` helper function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read excerpts of password-protected posts by simply viewing any page that contains a Spectra Post Grid, Post Masonry, Post Carousel, or Post Timeline block.",
