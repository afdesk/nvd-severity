  "Description": "The MailerLite - WooCommerce integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data modification and deletion in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.3. This is due to missing capability checks on the resetIntegration() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to reset the plugin's integration settings, delete all plugin options, and drop the plugin's database tables (woo_mailerlite_carts and woo_mailerlite_jobs), resulting in complete loss of plugin data including customer abandoned cart information and sync job history.",
