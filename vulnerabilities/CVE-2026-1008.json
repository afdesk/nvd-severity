  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the user profile text fields of Altium 365. Insufficient server-side input sanitization allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript payloads using whitespace-based attribute parsing bypass techniques.\nThe injected payload is persisted and executed when other users view the affected profile page, potentially allowing session token theft, phishing attacks, or malicious redirects. Exploitation requires an authenticated account and user interaction to view the crafted profile.",
