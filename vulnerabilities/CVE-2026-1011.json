  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Altium Support Center AddComment endpoint due to missing server-side input sanitization. Although the client interface applies HTML escaping, the backend accepts and stores arbitrary HTML and JavaScript supplied via modified POST requests.\n\nThe injected content is rendered verbatim when support cases are viewed by other users, including support staff with elevated privileges, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim\u2019s browser context.",
