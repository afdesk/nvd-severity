  "Description": "A flaw was identified in Keycloak\u2019s OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration feature when clients authenticate using private_key_jwt. The issue allows a client to specify an arbitrary jwks_uri, which Keycloak then retrieves without validating the destination. This enables attackers to coerce the Keycloak server into making HTTP requests to internal or restricted network resources. As a result, attackers can probe internal services and cloud metadata endpoints, creating an information disclosure and reconnaissance risk.",
