  "Description": "The JavaScript Notifier plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the `wp_footer` action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
