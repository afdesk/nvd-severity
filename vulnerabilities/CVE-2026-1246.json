  "Description": "The ShortPixel Image Optimizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read via path traversal in the 'loadFile' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.2 due to insufficient path validation and sanitization in the 'loadLogFile' AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information such as database credentials and authentication keys.",
