  "Description": "The Mail Mint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the 'forms', 'automation', 'email/templates', and 'contacts/import/tutorlms/map' API endpoints in all versions up to, and including, 1.19.2 . This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied 'order-by', 'order-type', and 'selectedCourses' parameters and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL queries. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries.",
