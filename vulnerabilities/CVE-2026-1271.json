  "Description": "The ProfileGrid \u2013 User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.7.2 via the 'pm_upload_image' and 'pm_upload_cover_image' AJAX actions. This is due to the update_user_meta() function being called outside of the user authorization check in public/partials/crop.php and public/partials/coverimg_crop.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change any user's profile picture or cover image, including administrators.",
