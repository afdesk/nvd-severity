  "Description": "The MailChimp Campaigns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4. This is due to missing capability checks on the `mailchimp_campaigns_manager_disconnect_app` function that is hooked to the AJAX action of the same name. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to disconnect the site from its MailChimp synchronization app, disrupting automated email campaigns and marketing integrations.",
