  "Description": "The WP Import \u2013 Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.37. This is due to insufficient escaping on the `file_name` parameter which is stored in the database during file upload and later used in raw SQL queries without proper sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries via a malicious filename, which can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. The vulnerability can only be exploited when the 'Single Import/Export' option is enabled, and the server is running a PHP version < 8.0.",
