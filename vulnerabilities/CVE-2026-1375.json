  "Description": "The Tutor LMS \u2013 eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.5. This is due to missing object-level authorization checks in the `course_list_bulk_action()`, `bulk_delete_course()`, and `update_course_status()` functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Tutor Instructor-level access and above, to modify or delete arbitrary courses they do not own by manipulating course IDs in bulk action requests.",
