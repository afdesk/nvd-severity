  "Description": "The Document Embedder \u2013 Embed PDFs, Word, Excel, and Other Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to the plugin not verifying that a user has permission to access the requested resource in the 'bplde_save_document_library', 'bplde_get_single', and 'bplde_delete_document_library' AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to read, modify, and delete Document Library entries created by other users, including administrators, via the 'id' parameter.",
