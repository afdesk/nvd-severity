  "Description": "The Vzaar Media Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] variable. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
