  "Description": "The Mail Mint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.19.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the create_or_update_note function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create or update contact notes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Due to missing sanitization and escaping this can lead to stored Cross-Site Scripting.",
