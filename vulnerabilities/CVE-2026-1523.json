  "Description": "Path Traversal vulnerability in Digitek ADT1100 and Digitek DT950 from PRIMION DIGITEK, S.L.U (Azkoyen Group). This vulnerability allows an attacker to access arbitrary files in the server's file system, thet is, 'http://<host>/..%2F..% 2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd'. By manipulating the input to include URL encoded directory traversal sequences (e.g., %2F representing /), an attacker can bypass the input validation mechanisms ans retrieve sensitive files outside the intended directory, which could lead to information disclosure or further system compromise.",
