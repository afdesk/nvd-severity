  "Description": "A flaw was found in foreman_kubevirt. When configuring the connection to OpenShift, the system disables SSL verification if a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is not explicitly set. This insecure default allows a remote attacker, capable of intercepting network traffic between Satellite and OpenShift, to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Such an attack could lead to the disclosure or alteration of sensitive information.",
