  "Description": "A flaw was found in libsoup. An attacker who can control the input for the Content-Disposition header can inject CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences into the header value. These sequences are then interpreted verbatim when the HTTP request or response is constructed, allowing arbitrary HTTP headers to be injected. This vulnerability can lead to HTTP header injection or HTTP response splitting without requiring authentication or user interaction.",
