  "Description": "Rapid7 InsightVM versions before\u00a08.34.0 contain a signature verification issue on the\u00a0Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) cloud endpoint that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to InsightVM accounts setup\nvia \"Security Console\" installations, resulting in full account takeover. The issue occurs due to the application processing these unsigned assertions and issuing session cookies that granted access to the\ntargeted user accounts. This has been fixed in version 8.34.0 of InsightVM.",
