  "Description": "The WP All Export plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.14 via the export download endpoint. This is due to a PHP type juggling vulnerability in the security token comparison which uses loose comparison (==) instead of strict comparison (===). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication using \"magic hash\" values when the expected MD5 hash prefix happens to be numeric-looking (matching pattern ^0e\\d+$), allowing download of sensitive export files containing PII, business data, or database information.",
