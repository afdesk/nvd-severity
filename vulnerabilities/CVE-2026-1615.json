  "Description": "Versions of the package jsonpath before 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection via unsafe evaluation of user-supplied JSON Path expressions. The library relies on the static-eval module to process JSON Path input, which is not designed to handle untrusted data safely. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious JSON Path expression that, when evaluated, executes arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to Remote Code Execution in Node.js environments or Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in browser contexts. This affects all methods that evaluate JSON Paths against objects, including .query, .nodes, .paths, .value, .parent, and .apply.",
