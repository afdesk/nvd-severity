  "Description": "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'redirect_to' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.46. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'redirect_to' GET parameter in the login form shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
