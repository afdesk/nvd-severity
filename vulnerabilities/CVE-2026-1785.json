  "Description": "The Code Snippets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the cloud snippet download and update actions in the Cloud_Search_List_Table class. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force logged-in administrators to download or update cloud snippets without their consent via a crafted request, granted they can trick an administrator into visiting a malicious page.",
