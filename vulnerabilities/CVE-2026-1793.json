  "Description": "The Element Pack Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file reads in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.17 via the SVG widget and a lack of sufficient file validation in the 'render_svg' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.",
