  "Description": "Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.4.50 and later are vulnerable to an insufficient entropy issue in the CredentialsKeyStorePassword.generateRandomPassword() method. When updating legacy keystore passwords, the application generates a new password with insufficient length (7-12 characters) and a static prefix 'p', resulting in a weak keyspace. An attacker with access to the nsc.ks file can brute-force this password using consumer-grade hardware to decrypt stored credentials.",
