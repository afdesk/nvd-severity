  "Description": "The Kali Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8. This is due to the `get_items_permissions_check()` permission callback on the `/kaliforms/v1/forms/{id}` REST API endpoint only checking for the `edit_posts` capability without verifying that the requesting user has ownership or authorization over the specific form resource. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to read form configuration data belonging to other users (including administrators) by enumerating form IDs. Exposed data includes form field structures, Google reCAPTCHA secret keys (if configured), email notification templates, and server paths.",
