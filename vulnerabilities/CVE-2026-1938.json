  "Description": "The YayMail \u2013 WooCommerce Email Customizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized license key deletion due to a missing authorization check on the `/yaymail-license/v1/license/delete` REST endpoint in versions up to, and including, 4.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to delete the plugin's license key via the '/yaymail-license/v1/license/delete' endpoint granted they can obtain the REST API nonce.",
