  "Description": "The Blog2Social: Social Media Auto Post & Scheduler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the b2s_curation_draft AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.7.4. The curationDraft() function only verifies current_user_can('read') without checking whether the user has edit_post permission for the target post. Combined with the plugin granting UI access and nonce exposure to all roles, this makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the title and content of arbitrary posts and pages by supplying a target post ID via the 'b2s-draft-id' parameter.",
