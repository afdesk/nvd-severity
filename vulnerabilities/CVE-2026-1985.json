  "Description": "The Press3D plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 3D Model Gutenberg block in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin failing to sanitize and validate the URL scheme when storing link URLs for 3D model blocks, allowing `javascript:` URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages via the link URL parameter that will execute whenever a user clicks on the 3D model.",
