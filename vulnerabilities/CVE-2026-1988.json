  "Description": "The Flexi Product Slider and Grid for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5 via the `flexipsg_carousel` shortcode. This is due to the `theme` parameter being directly concatenated into a file path without proper sanitization or validation, allowing directory traversal. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server via the `theme` parameter granted they can create posts with shortcodes.",
