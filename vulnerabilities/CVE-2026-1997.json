  "Description": "Certain HP OfficeJet Pro printers may expose information if Cross\u2011Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is misconfigured, potentially allowing unauthorized web origins to access device resource.\n\nCORS is disabled by default on Pro\u2011class devices and can only be enabled by an administrator through the Embedded Web Server (EWS). Keeping CORS disabled unless explicitly required helps ensure that only trusted solutions can interact with the device.",
