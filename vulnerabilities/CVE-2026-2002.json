  "Description": "The Forminator Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the form_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.50.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The plugin allows admins to give form management permissions to lower level users, which could make this exploitable by users such as subscribers.",
