  "Description": "Missing validation of multibyte character length in PostgreSQL text manipulation allows a database user to issue crafted queries that achieve a buffer overrun.  That suffices to execute arbitrary code as the operating system user running the database.  Versions before PostgreSQL 18.2, 17.8, 16.12, 15.16, and 14.21 are affected.",
