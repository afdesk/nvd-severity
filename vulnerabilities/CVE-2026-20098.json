An attacker could exploit this vulnerability&nbsp;by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files to the affected system. The malicious files could overwrite system files that are processed by the&nbsp;root system account and allow arbitrary command execution with&nbsp;root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of video operator.",
