  "Description": "The Cart All In One For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Code Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.21. This is due to insufficient input validation on the 'Assign page' field which is passed directly to the eval() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
