  "Description": "Microsoft Edge Elevation Service exposes a privileged COM interface that inadequately validates the privileges of the calling process. A standard (non\u2011administrator) local user can invoke the IElevatorEdge interface method LaunchUpdateCmdElevatedAndWait, causing the service to execute privileged update commands as LocalSystem.\nThis allows a non\u2011administrator to enable or disable Windows Virtualization\u2011Based Security (VBS) by modifying protected system registry keys under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\DeviceGuard. Disabling VBS weakens critical platform protections such as Credential Guard, Hypervisor\u2011protected Code Integrity (HVCI), and the Secure Kernel, resulting in a security feature bypass.",
