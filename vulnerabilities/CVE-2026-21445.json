  "Description": "Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior to version 1.7.0.dev45, multiple critical API endpoints in Langflow are missing authentication controls. The issue allows any unauthenticated user to access sensitive user conversation data, transaction histories, and perform destructive operations including message deletion. This affects endpoints handling personal data and system operations that should require proper authorization. Version 1.7.0.dev45 contains a patch.",
