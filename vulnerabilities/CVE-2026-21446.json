  "Description": "Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. In versions on the 2.3 branch prior to 2.3.10, API routes remain active even after initial installation is complete. The underlying API endpoints (`/install/api/*`) are directly accessible and exploitable without any authentication. An attacker can bypass the Ib installer entirely by calling the API endpoints directly. This allows any unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts, modify application configurations, and potentially overwrite existing data. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.",
