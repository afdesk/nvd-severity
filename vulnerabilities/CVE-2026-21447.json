  "Description": "Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. Prior to version 2.3.10, an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability in the customer order reorder function allows any authenticated customer to add items from another customer's order to their own shopping cart by manipulating the order ID parameter. This exposes sensitive purchase information and enables potential fraud. Version 2.3.10 patches the issue.",
