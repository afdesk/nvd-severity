  "Description": "Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bagisto prior to version 2.3.10 within the CMS page editor. Although the platform normally attempts to sanitize `<script>` tags, the filtering can be bypassed by manipulating the raw HTTP POST request before submission. As a result, arbitrary JavaScript can be stored in the CMS content and executed whenever the page is viewed or edited. This exposes administrators to a high-severity risk, including complete account takeover, backend hijacking, and malicious script execution. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.",
