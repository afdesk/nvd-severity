  "Description": "ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Versions 5.5.2-#187 and below allow an attacker to perform Blind SQL Injection through the add comment section within a channel. When adding a comment within a channel, there is a POST request to the /actions/ajax.php endpoint. The obj_id parameter within the POST request to /actions/ajax.php is then used within the user_exists function of the upload/includes/classes/user.class. php file as the $id parameter. It is then used within the count function of the upload/includes/classes/db.class. php file. The $id parameter is concatenated into the query without validation or sanitization, and a user-supplied input like 1' or 1=1-- - can be used to trigger the injection. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication.",
