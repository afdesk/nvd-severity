  "Description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the packet forwarding engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending a specific ICMP packet through a GRE tunnel to cause the PFE to crash and restart.\n\nWhen PowerMode IPsec (PMI) and GRE performance acceleration are enabled and the device receives a specific ICMP packet, a crash occurs in the SRX PFE, resulting in traffic loss. PMI is enabled by default, and GRE performance acceleration can be enabled by running the configuration command shown below.\u00a0PMI is a mode of operation that provides IPsec performance improvements using Vector Packet Processing.\n\nNote that PMI with GRE performance acceleration is only supported on specific SRX platforms.\nThis issue affects Junos OS on the SRX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.4R3-S12,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S8,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R2-S1,\u00a0\n  *  from 25.2 before 25.2R1-S1, 25.2R2.",
