  "Description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated attacker controlling an adjacent IS-IS neighbor to send a specific update packet causing a memory leak.\u00a0Continued receipt and processing of these packets will exhaust all available memory, crashing rpd and creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nMemory usage can be monitored through the use of the 'show task memory detail' command. For example:\n\nuser@junos> show task memory detail | match ted-infra\n\u00a0 TED-INFRA-COOKIE  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  25  \u00a0  1072  \u00a0 \u00a0  28  \u00a0  1184  \u00a0 \u00a0  229\n\n\n\nuser@junos> \n\nshow task memory detail | match ted-infra\n\u00a0 TED-INFRA-COOKIE  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  31  \u00a0  1360  \u00a0 \u00a0  34  \u00a0  1472  \u00a0 \u00a0  307\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS:\u00a0\n\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.1 before 24.1R2;\u00a0\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.1 before 24.1R2-EVO.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Junos OS versions before 23.2R1 or Junos OS Evolved versions before 23.2R1-EVO.",
