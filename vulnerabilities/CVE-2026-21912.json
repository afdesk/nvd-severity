  "Description": "A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in the method to collect FPC Ethernet firmware statistics\u00a0of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX10k Series allows a local, low-privileged attacker executing the 'show system firmware' CLI command to cause an LC480 or LC2101 line card to reset.\n\nOn MX10k Series systems with LC480 or LC2101 line cards, repeated execution of the 'show system firmware' CLI command can cause the line card to crash and restart. Additionally, some time after the line card crashes, chassisd may also crash and restart, generating a core dump.This issue affects Junos OS on MX10k Series:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S10,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S7,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S2,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2.",
