  "Description": "An Improper Locking vulnerability in the GTP plugin of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (Dos).\n\nIf an SRX Series device receives a specifically malformed GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) Modify Bearer Request message, a lock is acquired and never released. This results in other threads not being able to acquire a lock themselves, causing a watchdog timeout leading to FPC crash and restart. This issue leads to a complete traffic outage until the device has automatically recovered.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series:\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S5,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S6,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S3,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R2-S2,\n  *  25.2 versions before 25.2R1-S1, 25.2R2.",
