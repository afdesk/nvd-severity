  "Description": "A Double Free vulnerability in the flow processing daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX and MX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). On all SRX and MX Series platforms, when during TCP session establishment a specific sequence of packets is encountered a double free happens. This causes flowd to crash and the respective FPC to restart.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX and MX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S7,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S4,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2.",
