  "Description": "A Use After Free vulnerability in the chassis daemon (chassisd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based attacker authenticated with low privileges to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nWhen telemetry collectors are frequently subscribing and unsubscribing to sensors continuously over a long period of time, telemetry-capable processes like chassisd, rpd or mib2d will crash and restart, which - depending on the process - can cause a complete outage until the system has recovered.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n\u00a0Junos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S5,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2;\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8-EVO,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S5-EVO,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-EVO.",
