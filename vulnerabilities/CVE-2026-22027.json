  "Description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the convert_hexstring_to_byte_array() function in the MariaDB SA interface writes decoded bytes into a caller-provided buffer without any capacity check. When importing SA fields from the database (e.g., IV, ARSN, ABM), a malformed or oversized hex string in the database can overflow the destination buffer, corrupting adjacent heap memory. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.",
