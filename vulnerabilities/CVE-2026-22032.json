  "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.14.0, an open redirect vulnerability exists in the Directus SAML authentication callback endpoint. During SAML authentication, the `RelayState` parameter is intended to preserve the user's original destination. However, while the login initiation flow validates redirect targets against allowed domains, this validation is not applied to the callback endpoint. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious authentication request that redirects users to an arbitrary external URL upon completion. The vulnerability is present in both the success and error handling paths of the callback. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication. Version 11.14.0 contains a patch.",
