On deployments of Snuffleupagus prior to version 0.13.0 with the non-default upload validation feature enabled and configured to use one of the upstream validation scripts based on Vulcan Logic Disassembler (VLD) while the VLD extension is not available to the CLI SAPI, all files from multipart POST requests are evaluated as PHP code. The issue was fixed in version 0.13.0.",
