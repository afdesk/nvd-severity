  "Description": "RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. Prior to version 1.0.0-alpha.79, he `ImportIam` admin API validates permissions using `ExportIAMAction` instead of `ImportIAMAction`, allowing a principal with export-only IAM permissions to perform import operations. Since importing IAM data performs privileged write actions (creating/updating users, groups, policies, and service accounts), this can lead to unauthorized IAM modification and privilege escalation. Version 1.0.0-alpha.79 fixes the issue.",
