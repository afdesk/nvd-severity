  "Description": "RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. In versions 1.0.0-alpha.13 through 1.0.0-alpha.78, a flawed `deny_only` short-circuit in RustFS IAM allows a restricted service account or STS credential to self-issue an unrestricted service account, inheriting the parent\u2019s full privileges. This enables privilege escalation and bypass of session/inline policy restrictions. Version 1.0.0-alpha.79 fixes the issue.",
