  "Description": "Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to 2.11.35 and 3.6.7, there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik ACME TLS certificates' automatic generation: the ACME TLS-ALPN fast path can allow unauthenticated clients to tie up go routines and file descriptors indefinitely when the ACME TLS challenge is enabled. A malicious client can open many connections, send a minimal ClientHello with acme-tls/1, then stop responding, leading to denial of service of the entry point. The vulnerability is fixed in 2.11.35 and 3.6.7.",
