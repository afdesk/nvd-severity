  "Description": "OpenLDAP Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) versions up to and including 0.9.14, prior to commit 8e1fda8, contain a heap buffer underflow in the readline() function of mdb_load. When processing malformed input containing an embedded NUL byte, an unsigned offset calculation can underflow and cause an out-of-bounds read of one byte before the allocated heap buffer. This can cause mdb_load to crash, leading to a limited denial-of-service condition.",
