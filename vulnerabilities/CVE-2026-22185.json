  "Description": "OpenLDAP Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) mdb_load contains a heap buffer underflow vulnerability in the readline() function. When processing malformed input, an unsigned offset calculation can underflow a heap pointer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read of one byte before the allocated heap buffer. This may allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service and potentially disclose limited heap memory contents.",
