  "Description": "Panda3D versions up to and including 1.10.16 egg-mkfont contains an uncontrolled format string vulnerability. The -gp (glyph pattern) command-line option is used directly as the format string for sprintf() with only a single argument supplied. If an attacker provides additional format specifiers, egg-mkfont may read unintended stack values and write the formatted output into generated .egg and .png files, resulting in disclosure of stack-resident memory and pointer values.",
