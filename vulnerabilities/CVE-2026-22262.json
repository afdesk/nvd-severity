  "Description": "Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. While saving a dataset a stack buffer is used to prepare the data. Prior to versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14, if the data in the dataset is too large, this can result in a stack overflow. Versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14 contain a patch. As a workaround, do not use rules with datasets `save` nor `state` options.",
