  "Description": "Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine. Prior to version 8.0.3 and 7.0.14, an unsigned integer overflow can lead to a heap use-after-free condition when generating excessive amounts of alerts for a single packet. Versions 8.0.3 and 7.0.14 contain a patch. As a workaround, do not run untrusted rulesets or run with less than 65536 signatures that can match on the same packet.",
