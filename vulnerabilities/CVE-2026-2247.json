  "Description": "SQL injection vulnerability (SQLi) in Clicldeu SaaS, specifically in the generation of reports, which occurs when a previously authenticated remote attacker executes a malicious payload in the URL generated after downloading the student's report card in the \u2018Day-to-day\u2019 section from the mobile application.\n\nIn the URL of the generated PDF, the session token used does not expire, so it remains valid for days after its generation, and unusual characters can be entered after the \u2018id_alu\u2019 parameter, resulting in two types of SQLi: boolean-based blind and time-based blind. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access confidential information in the database.",
