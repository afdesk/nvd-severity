  "Description": "METIS DFS devices (versions <= oscore 2.1.234-r18) expose a web-based shell at the /console endpoint that does not require authentication. Accessing this endpoint allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with 'daemon' privileges. This results in the compromise of the software, granting unauthorized access to modify configuration, read and alter sensitive data, or disrupt services.",
