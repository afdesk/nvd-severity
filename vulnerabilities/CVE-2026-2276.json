  "Description": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Wix web application, where the endpoint ' https://manage.wix.com/account/account-settings ', responsible for uploading SVG images, does not properly sanitize the content. An authenticated attacker could upload an SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code, which is stored and subsequently executed when other users view the image. Exploiting this vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be executed in the context of the victim's browser, which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the abuse of the affected user's session.",
