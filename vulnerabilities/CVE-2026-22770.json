  "Description": "ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. The BilateralBlurImage method will allocate a set of double buffers inside AcquireBilateralTLS. But, in versions prior to 7.1.2-13, the last element in the set is not properly initialized. This will result in a release of an invalid pointer inside DestroyBilateralTLS when the memory allocation fails. Version 7.1.2-13 contains a patch for the issue.",
