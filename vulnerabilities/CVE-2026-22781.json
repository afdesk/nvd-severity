  "Description": "TinyWeb is a web server (HTTP, HTTPS) written in Delphi for Win32. TinyWeb HTTP Server before version 1.98 is vulnerable to OS command injection via CGI ISINDEX-style query parameters. The query parameters are passed as command-line arguments to the CGI executable via Windows CreateProcess().
