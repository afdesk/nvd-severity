  "Description": "RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. From >= 1.0.0-alpha.1 to 1.0.0-alpha.79, invalid RPC signatures cause the server to log the shared HMAC secret (and expected signature), which exposes the secret to log readers and enables forged RPC calls. In crates/ecstore/src/rpc/http_auth.rs, the invalid signature branch logs sensitive data. This log line includes secret and expected_signature, both derived from the shared HMAC key. Any invalidly signed request triggers this path. The function is reachable from RPC and admin request handlers. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.0-alpha.80.",
