  "Description": "Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to 7.1.0, an authorization vulnerability exists in Lychee's album password unlock functionality that allows users to gain possibly unauthorized access to other users' password-protected albums. When a user unlocks a password-protected public album, the system automatically unlocks ALL other public albums that share the same password, resulting in a complete authorization bypass. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.0.",
