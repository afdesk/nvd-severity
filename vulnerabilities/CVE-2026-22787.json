  "Description": "html2pdf.js converts any webpage or element into a printable PDF entirely client-side. Prior to 0.14.0, html2pdf.js contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when given a text source rather than an element. This text is not sufficiently sanitized before being attached to the DOM, allowing malicious scripts to be run on the client browser and risking the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the page's data. This vulnerability has been fixed in html2pdf.js@0.14.0.",
  "Severity": "UNKNOWN",
