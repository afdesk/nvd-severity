  "Description": "OpenCode is an open source AI coding agent. The markdown renderer used for LLM responses will insert arbitrary HTML into the DOM. There is no sanitization with DOMPurify or even a CSP on the web interface to prevent JavaScript execution via HTML injection. This means controlling the LLM response for a chat session gets JavaScript execution on the http://localhost:4096 origin. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.1.10.",
