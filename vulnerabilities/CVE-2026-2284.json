  "Description": "The News Element Elementor Blog Magazine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to a missing capability check and nonce verification on the 'ne_clean_data' AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to truncate 8 core WordPress database tables (posts, comments, terms, term_relationships, term_taxonomy, postmeta, commentmeta, termmeta) and delete the entire WordPress uploads directory, resulting in complete data loss.",
