  "Description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to 3.20.1, a heap-buffer-overflow occurs in drive read when a server-controlled read length is used to read file data into an IRP output stream buffer without a hard upper bound, allowing an oversized read to overwrite heap memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.20.1.",
