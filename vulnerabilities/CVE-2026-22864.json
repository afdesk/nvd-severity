  "Description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Before 2.5.6, a prior patch aimed to block spawning Windows batch/shell files by returning an error when a spawned path\u2019s extension matched .bat or .cmd. That check performs a case-sensitive comparison against lowercase literals and therefore can be bypassed when the extension uses alternate casing (for example .BAT, .Bat, etc.). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.6.",
