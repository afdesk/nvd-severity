  "Description": "GuardDog is a CLI tool to identify malicious PyPI packages. Prior to 2.7.1, GuardDog's safe_extract() function does not validate decompressed file sizes when extracting ZIP archives (wheels, eggs), allowing attackers to cause denial of service through zip bombs. A malicious package can consume gigabytes of disk space from a few megabytes of compressed data. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.7.1.",
