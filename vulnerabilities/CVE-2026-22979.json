  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix memory leak in skb_segment_list for GRO packets\n\nWhen skb_segment_list() is called during packet forwarding, it handles\npackets that were aggregated by the GRO engine.\n\nHistorically, the segmentation logic in skb_segment_list assumes that\nindividual segments are split from a parent SKB and may need to carry\ntheir own socket memory accounting. Accordingly, the code transfers\ntruesize from the parent to the newly created segments.\n\nPrior to commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\"), this\ntruesize subtraction in skb_segment_list() was valid because fragments\nstill carry a reference to the original socket.\n\nHowever, commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\") changed\nthis behavior by ensuring that fraglist entries are explicitly\norphaned (skb->sk = NULL) to prevent illegal orphaning later in the\nstack. This change meant that the entire socket memory charge remained\nwith the head SKB, but the corresponding accounting logic in\nskb_segment_list() was never updated.\n\nAs a result, the current code unconditionally adds each fragment's\ntruesize to delta_truesize and subtracts it from the parent SKB. Since\nthe fragments are no longer charged to the socket, this subtraction\nresults in an effective under-count of memory when the head is freed.\nThis causes sk_wmem_alloc to remain non-zero, preventing socket\ndestruction and leading to a persistent memory leak.\n\nThe leak can be observed via KMEMLEAK when tearing down the networking\nenvironment:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881e6eb9100 (size 2048):\n  comm \"ping\", pid 6720, jiffies 4295492526\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x5c6/0x800\n    sk_prot_alloc+0x5b/0x220\n    sk_alloc+0x35/0xa00\n    inet6_create.part.0+0x303/0x10d0\n    __sock_create+0x248/0x640\n    __sys_socket+0x11b/0x1d0\n\nSince skb_segment_list() is exclusively used for SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST\npackets constructed by GRO, the truesize adjustment is removed.\n\nThe call to skb_release_head_state() must be preserved. As documented in\ncommit cf673ed0e057 (\"net: fix fraglist segmentation reference count\nleak\"), it is still required to correctly drop references to SKB\nextensions that may be overwritten during __copy_skb_header().",
