  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag\n\nCommit 15faa1f67ab4 (\"lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag\")\nfixed a similar issue in the lan966x driver caused by a NULL pointer dereference.\nThe ocelot_set_aggr_pgids() function in the ocelot driver has similar logic\nand is susceptible to the same crash.\n\nThis issue specifically affects the ocelot_vsc7514.c frontend, which leaves\nunused ports as NULL pointers. The felix_vsc9959.c frontend is unaffected as\nit uses the DSA framework which registers all ports.\n\nFix this by checking if the port pointer is valid before accessing it.",
