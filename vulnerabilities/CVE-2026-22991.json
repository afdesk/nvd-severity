  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibceph: make free_choose_arg_map() resilient to partial allocation\n\nfree_choose_arg_map() may dereference a NULL pointer if its caller fails\nafter a partial allocation.\n\nFor example, in decode_choose_args(), if allocation of arg_map->args\nfails, execution jumps to the fail label and free_choose_arg_map() is\ncalled. Since arg_map->size is updated to a non-zero value before memory\nallocation, free_choose_arg_map() will iterate over arg_map->args and\ndereference a NULL pointer.\n\nTo prevent this potential NULL pointer dereference and make\nfree_choose_arg_map() more resilient, add checks for pointers before\niterating.",
