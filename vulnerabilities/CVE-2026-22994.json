  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix reference count leak in bpf_prog_test_run_xdp()\n\nsyzbot is reporting\n\n  unregister_netdevice: waiting for sit0 to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nproblem. A debug printk() patch found that a refcount is obtained at\nxdp_convert_md_to_buff() from bpf_prog_test_run_xdp().\n\nAccording to commit ec94670fcb3b (\"bpf: Support specifying ingress via\nxdp_md context in BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN\"), the refcount obtained by\nxdp_convert_md_to_buff() will be released by xdp_convert_buff_to_md().\n\nTherefore, we can consider that the error handling path introduced by\ncommit 1c1949982524 (\"bpf: introduce frags support to\nbpf_prog_test_run_xdp()\") forgot to call xdp_convert_buff_to_md().",
