  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nublk: fix use-after-free in ublk_partition_scan_work\n\nA race condition exists between the async partition scan work and device\nteardown that can lead to a use-after-free of ub->ub_disk:\n\n1. ublk_ctrl_start_dev() schedules partition_scan_work after add_disk()\n2. ublk_stop_dev() calls ublk_stop_dev_unlocked() which does:\n   - del_gendisk(ub->ub_disk)\n   - ublk_detach_disk() sets ub->ub_disk = NULL\n   - put_disk() which may free the disk\n3. The worker ublk_partition_scan_work() then dereferences ub->ub_disk\n   leading to UAF\n\nFix this by using ublk_get_disk()/ublk_put_disk() in the worker to hold\na reference to the disk during the partition scan. The spinlock in\nublk_get_disk() synchronizes with ublk_detach_disk() ensuring the worker\neither gets a valid reference or sees NULL and exits early.\n\nAlso change flush_work() to cancel_work_sync() to avoid running the\npartition scan work unnecessarily when the disk is already detached.",
