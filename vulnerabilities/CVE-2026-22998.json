  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-tcp: fix NULL pointer dereferences in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec\n\nCommit efa56305908b (\"nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length\")\nadded ttag bounds checking and data_offset\nvalidation in nvmet_tcp_handle_h2c_data_pdu(), but it did not validate\nwhether the command's data structures (cmd->req.sg and cmd->iov) have\nbeen properly initialized before processing H2C_DATA PDUs.\n\nThe nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec() function dereferences these pointers\nwithout NULL checks. This can be triggered by sending H2C_DATA PDU\nimmediately after the ICREQ/ICRESP handshake, before\nsending a CONNECT command or NVMe write command.\n\nAttack vectors that trigger NULL pointer dereferences:\n1. H2C_DATA PDU sent before CONNECT \u2192 both pointers NULL\n2. H2C_DATA PDU for READ command \u2192 cmd->req.sg allocated, cmd->iov NULL\n3. H2C_DATA PDU for uninitialized command slot \u2192 both pointers NULL\n\nThe fix validates both cmd->req.sg and cmd->iov before calling\nnvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec(). Both checks are required because:\n- Uninitialized commands: both NULL\n- READ commands: cmd->req.sg allocated, cmd->iov NULL\n- WRITE commands: both allocated",
