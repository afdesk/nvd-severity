  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmacvlan: fix possible UAF in macvlan_forward_source()\n\nAdd RCU protection on (struct macvlan_source_entry)->vlan.\n\nWhenever macvlan_hash_del_source() is called, we must clear\nentry->vlan pointer before RCU grace period starts.\n\nThis allows macvlan_forward_source() to skip over\nentries queued for freeing.\n\nNote that macvlan_dev are already RCU protected, as they\nare embedded in a standard netdev (netdev_priv(ndev)).\n\nhttps: //lore.kernel.org/netdev/695fb1e8.050a0220.1c677c.039f.GAE@google.com/T/#u",
