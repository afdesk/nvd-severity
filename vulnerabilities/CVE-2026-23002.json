  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib/buildid: use __kernel_read() for sleepable context\n\nPrevent a \"BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference in\nfilemap_read_folio\".\n\nFor the sleepable context, convert freader to use __kernel_read() instead\nof direct page cache access via read_cache_folio().  This simplifies the\nfaultable code path by using the standard kernel file reading interface\nwhich handles all the complexity of reading file data.\n\nAt the moment we are not changing the code for non-sleepable context which\nuses filemap_get_folio() and only succeeds if the target folios are\nalready in memory and up-to-date.  The reason is to keep the patch simple\nand easier to backport to stable kernels.\n\nSyzbot repro does not crash the kernel anymore and the selftests run\nsuccessfully.\n\nIn the follow up we will make __kernel_read() with IOCB_NOWAIT work for\nnon-sleepable contexts.  In addition, I would like to replace the\nsecretmem check with a more generic approach and will add fstest for the\nbuildid code.",
