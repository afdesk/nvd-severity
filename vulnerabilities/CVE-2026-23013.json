  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback\n\noctep_vf_request_irqs() requests MSI-X queue IRQs with dev_id set to\nioq_vector. If request_irq() fails part-way, the rollback loop calls\nfree_irq() with dev_id set to 'oct', which does not match the original\ndev_id and may leave the irqaction registered.\n\nThis can keep IRQ handlers alive while ioq_vector is later freed during\nunwind/teardown, leading to a use-after-free or crash when an interrupt\nfires.\n\nFix the error path to free IRQs with the same ioq_vector dev_id used\nduring request_irq().",
