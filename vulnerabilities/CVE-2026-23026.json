  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: qcom: gpi: Fix memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config()\n\nFix a memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config() where the original memory\npointed to by gchan->config could be lost if krealloc() fails.\n\nThe issue occurs when:\n1. gchan->config points to previously allocated memory\n2. krealloc() fails and returns NULL\n3. The function directly assigns NULL to gchan->config, losing the\n   reference to the original memory\n4. The original memory becomes unreachable and cannot be freed\n\nFix this by using a temporary variable to hold the krealloc() result\nand only updating gchan->config when the allocation succeeds.\n\nFound via static analysis and code review.",
