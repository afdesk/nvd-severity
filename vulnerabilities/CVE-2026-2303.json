  "Description": "The mongo-go-driver repository\u00a0contains CGo bindings for GSSAPI (Kerberos) authentication on Linux and macOS. The C wrapper implementation contains a heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to incorrect assumptions about string termination in the GSSAPI standard. Since GSSAPI buffers are not guaranteed to be null-terminated or have extra padding, this results in reading one byte past the allocated heap buffer.",
