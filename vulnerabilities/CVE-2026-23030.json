  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nphy: rockchip: inno-usb2: Fix a double free bug in rockchip_usb2phy_probe()\n\nThe for_each_available_child_of_node() calls of_node_put() to\nrelease child_np in each success loop. After breaking from the\nloop with the child_np has been released, the code will jump to\nthe put_child label and will call the of_node_put() again if the\ndevm_request_threaded_irq() fails. These cause a double free bug.\n\nFix by returning directly to avoid the duplicate of_node_put().",
