  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak\n\nIn gs_can_open(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to the\nparent->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the complete callback\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(), the URB is processed and resubmitted. In\ngs_can_close() the URBs are freed by calling\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs(parent->rx_submitted).\n\nHowever, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors\nthe URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an\nin-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not\nreleased in gs_can_close().\n\nFix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() to the parent->rx_submitted anchor.",
