  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: etas_es58x: allow partial RX URB allocation to succeed\n\nWhen es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() fails to allocate the requested number of\nURBs but succeeds in allocating some, it returns an error code.\nThis causes es58x_open() to return early, skipping the cleanup label\n'free_urbs', which leads to the anchored URBs being leaked.\n\nAs pointed out by maintainer Vincent Mailhol, the driver is designed\nto handle partial URB allocation gracefully. Therefore, partial\nallocation should not be treated as a fatal error.\n\nModify es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() to return 0 if at least one URB has been\nallocated, restoring the intended behavior and preventing the leak\nin es58x_open().",
