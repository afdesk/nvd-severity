  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nidpf: fix aux device unplugging when rdma is not supported by vport\n\nIf vport flags do not contain VIRTCHNL2_VPORT_ENABLE_RDMA, driver does not\nallocate vdev_info for this vport. This leads to kernel NULL pointer\ndereference in idpf_idc_vport_dev_down(), which references vdev_info for\nevery vport regardless.\n\nCheck, if vdev_info was ever allocated before unplugging aux device.",
