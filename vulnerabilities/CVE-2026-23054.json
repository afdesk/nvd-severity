  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hv_netvsc: reject RSS hash key programming without RX indirection table\n\nRSS configuration requires a valid RX indirection table. When the device\nreports a single receive queue, rndis_filter_device_add() does not\nallocate an indirection table, accepting RSS hash key updates in this\nstate leads to a hang.\n\nFix this by gating netvsc_set_rxfh() on ndc->rx_table_sz and return\n-EOPNOTSUPP when the table is absent. This aligns set_rxfh with the device\ncapabilities and prevents incorrect behavior.",
