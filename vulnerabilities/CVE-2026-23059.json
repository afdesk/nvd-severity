  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: qla2xxx: Sanitize payload size to prevent member overflow\n\nIn qla27xx_copy_fpin_pkt() and qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), the frame_size\nreported by firmware is used to calculate the copy length into\nitem->iocb. However, the iocb member is defined as a fixed-size 64-byte\narray within struct purex_item.\n\nIf the reported frame_size exceeds 64 bytes, subsequent memcpy calls will\noverflow the iocb member boundary. While extra memory might be allocated,\nthis cross-member write is unsafe and triggers warnings under\nCONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.\n\nFix this by capping total_bytes to the size of the iocb member (64 bytes)\nbefore allocation and copying. This ensures all copies remain within the\nbounds of the destination structure member.",
