  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: authencesn - reject too-short AAD (assoclen<8) to match ESP/ESN spec\n\nauthencesn assumes an ESP/ESN-formatted AAD. When assoclen is shorter than\nthe minimum expected length, crypto_authenc_esn_decrypt() can advance past\nthe end of the destination scatterlist and trigger a NULL pointer dereference\nin scatterwalk_map_and_copy(), leading to a kernel panic (DoS).\n\nAdd a minimum AAD length check to fail fast on invalid inputs.",
