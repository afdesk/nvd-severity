  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix kernel panic in GET_INSTANCE_ID macro\n\nThe GET_INSTANCE_ID macro that caused a kernel panic when accessing sysfs\nattributes:\n\n1. Off-by-one error: The loop condition used '<=' instead of '<',\n   causing access beyond array bounds. Since array indices are 0-based\n   and go from 0 to instances_count-1, the loop should use '<'.\n\n2. Missing NULL check: The code dereferenced attr_name_kobj->name\n   without checking if attr_name_kobj was NULL, causing a null pointer\n   dereference in min_length_show() and other attribute show functions.\n\nThe panic occurred when fwupd tried to read BIOS configuration attributes:\n\n  Oops: general protection fault [#1] SMP KASAN NOPTI\n  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]\n  RIP: 0010:min_length_show+0xcf/0x1d0 [hp_bioscfg]\n\nAdd a NULL check for attr_name_kobj before dereferencing and corrects\nthe loop boundary to match the pattern used elsewhere in the driver.",
