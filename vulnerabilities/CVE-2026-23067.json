  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/io-pgtable-arm: fix size_t signedness bug in unmap path\n\n__arm_lpae_unmap() returns size_t but was returning -ENOENT (negative\nerror code) when encountering an unmapped PTE. Since size_t is unsigned,\n-ENOENT (typically -2) becomes a huge positive value (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE\non 64-bit systems).\n\nThis corrupted value propagates through the call chain:\n  __arm_lpae_unmap() returns -ENOENT as size_t\n  -> arm_lpae_unmap_pages() returns it\n  -> __iommu_unmap() adds it to iova address\n  -> iommu_pgsize() triggers BUG_ON due to corrupted iova\n\nThis can cause IOVA address overflow in __iommu_unmap() loop and\ntrigger BUG_ON in iommu_pgsize() from invalid address alignment.\n\nFix by returning 0 instead of -ENOENT. The WARN_ON already signals\nthe error condition, and returning 0 (meaning \"nothing unmapped\")\nis the correct semantic for size_t return type. This matches the\nbehavior of other io-pgtable implementations (io-pgtable-arm-v7s,\nio-pgtable-dart) which return 0 on error conditions.",
