  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: spi-sprd-adi: Fix double free in probe error path\n\nThe driver currently uses spi_alloc_host() to allocate the controller\nbut registers it using devm_spi_register_controller().\n\nIf devm_register_restart_handler() fails, the code jumps to the\nput_ctlr label and calls spi_controller_put(). However, since the\ncontroller was registered via a devm function, the device core will\nautomatically call spi_controller_put() again when the probe fails.\nThis results in a double-free of the spi_controller structure.\n\nFix this by switching to devm_spi_alloc_host() and removing the\nmanual spi_controller_put() call.",
