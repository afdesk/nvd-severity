  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock/virtio: fix potential underflow in virtio_transport_get_credit()\n\nThe credit calculation in virtio_transport_get_credit() uses unsigned\narithmetic:\n\n  ret = vvs->peer_buf_alloc - (vvs->tx_cnt - vvs->peer_fwd_cnt);\n\nIf the peer shrinks its advertised buffer (peer_buf_alloc) while bytes\nare in flight, the subtraction can underflow and produce a large\npositive value, potentially allowing more data to be queued than the\npeer can handle.\n\nReuse virtio_transport_has_space() which already handles this case and\nadd a comment to make it clear why we are doing that.\n\n[Stefano: use virtio_transport_has_space() instead of duplicating the code]\n[Stefano: tweak the commit message]",
