  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: scarlett2: Fix buffer overflow in config retrieval\n\nThe scarlett2_usb_get_config() function has a logic error in the\nendianness conversion code that can cause buffer overflows when\ncount > 1.\n\nThe code checks `if (size == 2)` where `size` is the total buffer size in\nbytes, then loops `count` times treating each element as u16 (2 bytes).\nThis causes the loop to access `count * 2` bytes when the buffer only\nhas `size` bytes allocated.\n\nFix by checking the element size (config_item->size) instead of the\ntotal buffer size. This ensures the endianness conversion matches the\nactual element type.",
