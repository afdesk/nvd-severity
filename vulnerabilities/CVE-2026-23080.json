  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: mcba_usb: mcba_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak\n\nFix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a (\"can: gs_usb:\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak\").\n\nIn mcba_usb_probe() -> mcba_usb_start(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are\nallocated, added to the priv->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the\ncomplete callback mcba_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and\nresubmitted. In mcba_usb_close() -> mcba_urb_unlink() the URBs are freed by\ncalling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&priv->rx_submitted).\n\nHowever, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors\nthe URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an\nin-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not\nreleased in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().\n\nFix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the\nmcba_usb_read_bulk_callback()to the priv->rx_submitted anchor.",
