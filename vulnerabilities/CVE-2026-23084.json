  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbe2net: Fix NULL pointer dereference in be_cmd_get_mac_from_list\n\nWhen the parameter pmac_id_valid argument of be_cmd_get_mac_from_list() is\nset to false, the driver may request the PMAC_ID from the firmware of the\nnetwork card, and this function will store that PMAC_ID at the provided\naddress pmac_id. This is the contract of this function.\n\nHowever, there is a location within the driver where both\npmac_id_valid == false and pmac_id == NULL are being passed. This could\nresult in dereferencing a NULL pointer.\n\nTo resolve this issue, it is necessary to pass the address of a stub\nvariable to the function.",
