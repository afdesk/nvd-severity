  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v3-its: Avoid truncating memory addresses\n\nOn 32-bit machines with CONFIG_ARM_LPAE, it is possible for lowmem\nallocations to be backed by addresses physical memory above the 32-bit\naddress limit, as found while experimenting with larger VMSPLIT\nconfigurations.\n\nThis caused the qemu virt model to crash in the GICv3 driver, which\nallocates the 'itt' object using GFP_KERNEL. Since all memory below\nthe 4GB physical address limit is in ZONE_DMA in this configuration,\nkmalloc() defaults to higher addresses for ZONE_NORMAL, and the\nITS driver stores the physical address in a 32-bit 'unsigned long'\nvariable.\n\nChange the itt_addr variable to the correct phys_addr_t type instead,\nalong with all other variables in this driver that hold a physical\naddress.\n\nThe gicv5 driver correctly uses u64 variables, while all other irqchip\ndrivers don't call virt_to_phys or similar interfaces. It's expected that\nother device drivers have similar issues, but fixing this one is\nsufficient for booting a virtio based guest.",
