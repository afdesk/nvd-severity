  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuacce: fix isolate sysfs check condition\n\nuacce supports the device isolation feature. If the driver\nimplements the isolate_err_threshold_read and\nisolate_err_threshold_write callback functions, uacce will create\nsysfs files now. Users can read and configure the isolation policy\nthrough sysfs. Currently, sysfs files are created as long as either\nisolate_err_threshold_read or isolate_err_threshold_write callback\nfunctions are present.\n\nHowever, accessing a non-existent callback function may cause the\nsystem to crash. Therefore, intercept the creation of sysfs if\nneither read nor write exists; create sysfs if either is supported,\nbut intercept unsupported operations at the call site.",
