  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuacce: fix cdev handling in the cleanup path\n\nWhen cdev_device_add fails, it internally releases the cdev memory,\nand if cdev_device_del is then executed, it will cause a hang error.\nTo fix it, we check the return value of cdev_device_add() and clear\nuacce->cdev to avoid calling cdev_device_del in the uacce_remove.",
