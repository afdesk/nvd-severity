  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmigrate: correct lock ordering for hugetlb file folios\n\nSyzbot has found a deadlock (analyzed by Lance Yang):\n\n1) Task (5749): Holds folio_lock, then tries to acquire i_mmap_rwsem(read lock).\n2) Task (5754): Holds i_mmap_rwsem(write lock), then tries to acquire\nfolio_lock.\n\nmigrate_pages()\n  -> migrate_hugetlbs()\n    -> unmap_and_move_huge_page()     <- Takes folio_lock!\n      -> remove_migration_ptes()\n        -> __rmap_walk_file()\n          -> i_mmap_lock_read()       <- Waits for i_mmap_rwsem(read lock)!\n\nhugetlbfs_fallocate()\n  -> hugetlbfs_punch_hole()           <- Takes i_mmap_rwsem(write lock)!\n    -> hugetlbfs_zero_partial_page()\n     -> filemap_lock_hugetlb_folio()\n      -> filemap_lock_folio()\n        -> __filemap_get_folio        <- Waits for folio_lock!\n\nThe migration path is the one taking locks in the wrong order according to\nthe documentation at the top of mm/rmap.c.  So expand the scope of the\nexisting i_mmap_lock to cover the calls to remove_migration_ptes() too.\n\nThis is (mostly) how it used to be after commit c0d0381ade79.  That was\nremoved by 336bf30eb765 for both file & anon hugetlb pages when it should\nonly have been removed for anon hugetlb pages.",
