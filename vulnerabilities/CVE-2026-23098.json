  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetrom: fix double-free in nr_route_frame()\n\nIn nr_route_frame(), old_skb is immediately freed without checking if\nnr_neigh->ax25 pointer is NULL. Therefore, if nr_neigh->ax25 is NULL,\nthe caller function will free old_skb again, causing a double-free bug.\n\nTherefore, to prevent this, we need to modify it to check whether\nnr_neigh->ax25 is NULL before freeing old_skb.",
