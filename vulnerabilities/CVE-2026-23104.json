  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix devlink reload call trace\n\nCommit 4da71a77fc3b (\"ice: read internal temperature sensor\") introduced\ninternal temperature sensor reading via HWMON. ice_hwmon_init() was added\nto ice_init_feature() and ice_hwmon_exit() was added to ice_remove(). As a\nresult if devlink reload is used to reinit the device and then the driver\nis removed, a call trace can occur.\n\nBUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc0fd4b5d\nCall Trace:\n string+0x48/0xe0\n vsnprintf+0x1f9/0x650\n sprintf+0x62/0x80\n name_show+0x1f/0x30\n dev_attr_show+0x19/0x60\n\nThe call trace repeats approximately every 10 minutes when system\nmonitoring tools (e.g., sadc) attempt to read the orphaned hwmon sysfs\nattributes that reference freed module memory.\n\nThe sequence is:\n1. Driver load, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from ice_init_feature()\n2. Devlink reload down, flow does not call ice_remove()\n3. Devlink reload up, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from\n   ice_init_feature() resulting in a second instance\n4. Driver unload, ice_hwmon_exit() called from ice_remove() leaving the\n   first hwmon instance orphaned with dangling pointer\n\nFix this by moving ice_hwmon_exit() from ice_remove() to\nice_deinit_features() to ensure proper cleanup symmetry with\nice_hwmon_init().",
