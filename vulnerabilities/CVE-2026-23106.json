  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntimekeeping: Adjust the leap state for the correct auxiliary timekeeper\n\nWhen __do_ajdtimex() was introduced to handle adjtimex for any\ntimekeeper, this reference to tk_core was not updated. When called on an\nauxiliary timekeeper, the core timekeeper would be updated incorrectly.\n\nThis gets caught by the lock debugging diagnostics because the\ntimekeepers sequence lock gets written to without holding its\nassociated spinlock:\n\nWARNING: include/linux/seqlock.h:226 at __do_adjtimex+0x394/0x3b0, CPU#2: test/125\naux_clock_adj (kernel/time/timekeeping.c:2979)\n__do_sys_clock_adjtime (kernel/time/posix-timers.c:1161 kernel/time/posix-timers.c:1173)\ndo_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 (discriminator 1) arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94 (discriminator 1))\nentry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:131)\n\nUpdate the correct auxiliary timekeeper.",
