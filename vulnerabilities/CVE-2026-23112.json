  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-tcp: add bounds checks in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec\n\nnvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec() could walk past cmd->req.sg when a PDU\nlength or offset exceeds sg_cnt and then use bogus sg->length/offset\nvalues, leading to _copy_to_iter() GPF/KASAN. Guard sg_idx, remaining\nentries, and sg->length/offset before building the bvec.",
