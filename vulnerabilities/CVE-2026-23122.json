  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigc: Reduce TSN TX packet buffer from 7KB to 5KB per queue\n\nThe previous 7 KB per queue caused TX unit hangs under heavy\ntimestamping load. Reducing to 5 KB avoids these hangs and matches\nthe TSN recommendation in I225/I226 SW User Manual Section 7.5.4.\n\nThe 8 KB \"freed\" by this change is currently unused. This reduction\nis not expected to impact throughput, as the i226 is PCIe-limited\nfor small TSN packets rather than TX-buffer-limited.",
