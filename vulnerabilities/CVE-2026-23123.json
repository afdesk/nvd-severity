  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ninterconnect: debugfs: initialize src_node and dst_node to empty strings\n\nThe debugfs_create_str() API assumes that the string pointer is either NULL\nor points to valid kmalloc() memory. Leaving the pointer uninitialized can\ncause problems.\n\nInitialize src_node and dst_node to empty strings before creating the\ndebugfs entries to guarantee that reads and writes are safe.",
