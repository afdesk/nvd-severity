  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: fix dead lock while flushing management frames\n\nCommit [1] converted the management transmission work item into a\nwiphy work. Since a wiphy work can only run under wiphy lock\nprotection, a race condition happens in below scenario:\n\n1. a management frame is queued for transmission.\n2. ath12k_mac_op_flush() gets called to flush pending frames associated\n   with the hardware (i.e, vif being NULL). Then in ath12k_mac_flush()\n   the process waits for the transmission done.\n3. Since wiphy lock has been taken by the flush process, the transmission\n   work item has no chance to run, hence the dead lock.\n\n>From user view, this dead lock results in below issue:\n\n wlp8s0: authenticate with xxxxxx (local address=xxxxxx)\n wlp8s0: send auth to xxxxxx (try 1/3)\n wlp8s0: authenticate with xxxxxx (local address=xxxxxx)\n wlp8s0: send auth to xxxxxx (try 1/3)\n wlp8s0: authenticated\n wlp8s0: associate with xxxxxx (try 1/3)\n wlp8s0: aborting association with xxxxxx by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)\n ath12k_pci 0000:08:00.0: failed to flush mgmt transmit queue, mgmt pkts pending 1\n\nThe dead lock can be avoided by invoking wiphy_work_flush() to proactively\nrun the queued work item. Note actually it is already present in\nath12k_mac_op_flush(), however it does not protect the case where vif\nbeing NULL. Hence move it ahead to cover this case as well.\n\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.1.c5-00302-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-1.115823.3",
