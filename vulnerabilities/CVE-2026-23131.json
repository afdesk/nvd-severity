  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix kobject warnings for empty attribute names\n\nThe hp-bioscfg driver attempts to register kobjects with empty names when\nthe HP BIOS returns attributes with empty name strings. This causes\nmultiple kernel warnings:\n\n  kobject: (00000000135fb5e6): attempted to be registered with empty name!\n  WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 3336 at lib/kobject.c:219 kobject_add_internal+0x2eb/0x310\n\nAdd validation in hp_init_bios_buffer_attribute() to check if the\nattribute name is empty after parsing it from the WMI buffer. If empty,\nlog a debug message and skip registration of that attribute, allowing the\nmodule to continue processing other valid attributes.",
