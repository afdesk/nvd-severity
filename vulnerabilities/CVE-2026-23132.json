  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/bridge: synopsys: dw-dp: fix error paths of dw_dp_bind\n\nFix several issues in dw_dp_bind() error handling:\n\n1. Missing return after drm_bridge_attach() failure - the function\n   continued execution instead of returning an error.\n\n2. Resource leak: drm_dp_aux_register() is not a devm function, so\n   drm_dp_aux_unregister() must be called on all error paths after\n   aux registration succeeds. This affects errors from:\n   - drm_bridge_attach()\n   - phy_init()\n   - devm_add_action_or_reset()\n   - platform_get_irq()\n   - devm_request_threaded_irq()\n\n3. Bug fix: platform_get_irq() returns the IRQ number or a negative\n   error code, but the error path was returning ERR_PTR(ret) instead\n   of ERR_PTR(dp->irq).\n\nUse a goto label for cleanup to ensure consistent error handling.",
