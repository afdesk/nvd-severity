  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nof: unittest: Fix memory leak in unittest_data_add()\n\nIn unittest_data_add(), if of_resolve_phandles() fails, the allocated\nunittest_data is not freed, leading to a memory leak.\n\nFix this by using scope-based cleanup helper __free(kfree) for automatic\nresource cleanup. This ensures unittest_data is automatically freed when\nit goes out of scope in error paths.\n\nFor the success path, use retain_and_null_ptr() to transfer ownership\nof the memory to the device tree and prevent double freeing.",
