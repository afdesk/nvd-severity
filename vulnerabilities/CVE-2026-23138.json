  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Add recursion protection in kernel stack trace recording\n\nA bug was reported about an infinite recursion caused by tracing the rcu\nevents with the kernel stack trace trigger enabled. The stack trace code\ncalled back into RCU which then called the stack trace again.\n\nExpand the ftrace recursion protection to add a set of bits to protect\nevents from recursion. Each bit represents the context that the event is\nin (normal, softirq, interrupt and NMI).\n\nHave the stack trace code use the interrupt context to protect against\nrecursion.\n\nNote, the bug showed an issue in both the RCU code as well as the tracing\nstacktrace code. This only handles the tracing stack trace side of the\nbug. The RCU fix will be handled separately.",
