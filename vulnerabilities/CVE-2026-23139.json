  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_conncount: update last_gc only when GC has been performed\n\nCurrently last_gc is being updated everytime a new connection is\ntracked, that means that it is updated even if a GC wasn't performed.\nWith a sufficiently high packet rate, it is possible to always bypass\nthe GC, causing the list to grow infinitely.\n\nUpdate the last_gc value only when a GC has been actually performed.",
