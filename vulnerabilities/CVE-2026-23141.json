  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: send: check for inline extents in range_is_hole_in_parent()\n\nBefore accessing the disk_bytenr field of a file extent item we need\nto check if we are dealing with an inline extent.\nThis is because for inline extents their data starts at the offset of\nthe disk_bytenr field. So accessing the disk_bytenr\nmeans we are accessing inline data or in case the inline data is less\nthan 8 bytes we can actually cause an invalid\nmemory access if this inline extent item is the first item in the leaf\nor access metadata from other items.",
