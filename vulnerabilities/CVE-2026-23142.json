  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/sysfs-scheme: cleanup access_pattern subdirs on scheme dir setup failure\n\nWhen a DAMOS-scheme DAMON sysfs directory setup fails after setup of\naccess_pattern/ directory, subdirectories of access_pattern/ directory are\nnot cleaned up.  As a result, DAMON sysfs interface is nearly broken until\nthe system reboots, and the memory for the unremoved directory is leaked.\n\nCleanup the directories under such failures.",
