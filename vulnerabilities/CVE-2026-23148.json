  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet: fix race in nvmet_bio_done() leading to NULL pointer dereference\n\nThere is a race condition in nvmet_bio_done() that can cause a NULL\npointer dereference in blk_cgroup_bio_start():\n\n1. nvmet_bio_done() is called when a bio completes\n2. nvmet_req_complete() is called, which invokes req->ops->queue_response(req)\n3. The queue_response callback can re-queue and re-submit the same request\n4. The re-submission reuses the same inline_bio from nvmet_req\n5. Meanwhile, nvmet_req_bio_put() (called after nvmet_req_complete)\n   invokes bio_uninit() for inline_bio, which sets bio->bi_blkg to NULL\n6. The re-submitted bio enters submit_bio_noacct_nocheck()\n7. blk_cgroup_bio_start() dereferences bio->bi_blkg, causing a crash:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  RIP: 0010:blk_cgroup_bio_start+0x10/0xd0\n  Call Trace:\n   submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x44/0x250\n   nvmet_bdev_execute_rw+0x254/0x370 [nvmet]\n   process_one_work+0x193/0x3c0\n   worker_thread+0x281/0x3a0\n\nFix this by reordering nvmet_bio_done() to call nvmet_req_bio_put()\nBEFORE nvmet_req_complete(). This ensures the bio is cleaned up before\nthe request can be re-submitted, preventing the race condition.",
