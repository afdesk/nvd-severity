  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm: Do not allow userspace to trigger kernel warnings in drm_gem_change_handle_ioctl()\n\nSince GEM bo handles are u32 in the uapi and the internal implementation\nuses idr_alloc() which uses int ranges, passing a new handle larger than\nINT_MAX trivially triggers a kernel warning:\n\nidr_alloc():\n...\n\tif (WARN_ON_ONCE(start < 0))\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n...\n\nFix it by rejecting new handles above INT_MAX and at the same time make\nthe end limit calculation more obvious by moving into int domain.",
