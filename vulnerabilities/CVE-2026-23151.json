  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: MGMT: Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete\n\nFix memory leak in set_ssp_complete() where mgmt_pending_cmd structures\nare not freed after being removed from the pending list.\n\nCommit 302a1f674c00 (\"Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix possible UAFs\") replaced\nmgmt_pending_foreach() calls with individual command handling but missed\nadding mgmt_pending_free() calls in both error and success paths of\nset_ssp_complete(). Other completion functions like set_le_complete()\nwere fixed correctly in the same commit.\n\nThis causes a memory leak of the mgmt_pending_cmd structure and its\nassociated parameter data for each SSP command that completes.\n\nAdd the missing mgmt_pending_free(cmd) calls in both code paths to fix\nthe memory leak. Also fix the same issue in set_advertising_complete().",
