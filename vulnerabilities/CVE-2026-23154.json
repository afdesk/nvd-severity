  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix segmentation of forwarding fraglist GRO\n\nThis patch enhances GSO segment handling by properly checking\nthe SKB_GSO_DODGY flag for frag_list GSO packets, addressing\nlow throughput issues observed when a station accesses IPv4\nservers via hotspots with an IPv6-only upstream interface.\n\nSpecifically, it fixes a bug in GSO segmentation when forwarding\nGRO packets containing a frag_list. The function skb_segment_list\ncannot correctly process GRO skbs that have been converted by XLAT,\nsince XLAT only translates the header of the head skb. Consequently,\nskbs in the frag_list may remain untranslated, resulting in protocol\ninconsistencies and reduced throughput.\n\nTo address this, the patch explicitly sets the SKB_GSO_DODGY flag\nfor GSO packets in XLAT's IPv4/IPv6 protocol translation helpers\n(bpf_skb_proto_4_to_6 and bpf_skb_proto_6_to_4). This marks GSO\npackets as potentially modified after protocol translation. As a\nresult, GSO segmentation will avoid using skb_segment_list and\ninstead falls back to skb_segment for packets with the SKB_GSO_DODGY\nflag. This ensures that only safe and fully translated frag_list\npackets are processed by skb_segment_list, resolving protocol\ninconsistencies and improving throughput when forwarding GRO packets\nconverted by XLAT.",
