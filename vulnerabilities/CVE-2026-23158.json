  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpio: virtuser: fix UAF in configfs release path\n\nThe gpio-virtuser configfs release path uses guard(mutex) to protect\nthe device structure. However, the device is freed before the guard\ncleanup runs, causing mutex_unlock() to operate on freed memory.\n\nSpecifically, gpio_virtuser_device_config_group_release() destroys\nthe mutex and frees the device while still inside the guard(mutex)\nscope. When the function returns, the guard cleanup invokes\nmutex_unlock(&dev->lock), resulting in a slab use-after-free.\n\nLimit the mutex lifetime by using a scoped_guard() only around the\nactivation check, so that the lock is released before mutex_destroy()\nand kfree() are called.",
