  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteon_ep: Fix memory leak in octep_device_setup()\n\nIn octep_device_setup(), if octep_ctrl_net_init() fails, the function\nreturns directly without unmapping the mapped resources and freeing the\nallocated configuration memory.\n\nFix this by jumping to the unsupported_dev label, which performs the\nnecessary cleanup. This aligns with the error handling logic of other\npaths in this function.\n\nCompile tested only. Issue found using a prototype static analysis tool\nand code review.",
