  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrocker: fix memory leak in rocker_world_port_post_fini()\n\nIn rocker_world_port_pre_init(), rocker_port->wpriv is allocated with\nkzalloc(wops->port_priv_size, GFP_KERNEL). However, in\nrocker_world_port_post_fini(), the memory is only freed when\nwops->port_post_fini callback is set:\n\n    if (!wops->port_post_fini)\n        return;\n    wops->port_post_fini(rocker_port);\n    kfree(rocker_port->wpriv);\n\nSince rocker_ofdpa_ops does not implement port_post_fini callback\n(it is NULL), the wpriv memory allocated for each port is never freed\nwhen ports are removed. This leads to a memory leak of\nsizeof(struct ofdpa_port) bytes per port on every device removal.\n\nFix this by always calling kfree(rocker_port->wpriv) regardless of\nwhether the port_post_fini callback exists.",
