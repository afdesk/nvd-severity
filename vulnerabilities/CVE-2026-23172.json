  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: wwan: t7xx: fix potential skb->frags overflow in RX path\n\nWhen receiving data in the DPMAIF RX path,\nthe t7xx_dpmaif_set_frag_to_skb() function adds\npage fragments to an skb without checking if the number of\nfragments has exceeded MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This could lead to a buffer overflow\nin skb_shinfo(skb)->frags[] array, corrupting adjacent memory and\npotentially causing kernel crashes or other undefined behavior.\n\nThis issue was identified through static code analysis by comparing with a\nsimilar vulnerability fixed in the mt76 driver commit b102f0c522cf (\"mt76:\nfix array overflow on receiving too many fragments for a packet\").\n\nThe vulnerability could be triggered if the modem firmware sends packets\nwith excessive fragments. While under normal protocol conditions (MTU 3080\nbytes, BAT buffer 3584 bytes),\na single packet should not require additional\nfragments, the kernel should not blindly trust firmware behavior.\nMalicious, buggy, or compromised firmware could potentially craft packets\nwith more fragments than the kernel expects.\n\nFix this by adding a bounds check before calling skb_add_rx_frag() to\nensure nr_frags does not exceed MAX_SKB_FRAGS.\n\nThe check must be performed before unmapping to avoid a page leak\nand double DMA unmap during device teardown.",
