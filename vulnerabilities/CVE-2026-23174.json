  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-pci: handle changing device dma map requirements\n\nThe initial state of dma_needs_unmap may be false, but change to true\nwhile mapping the data iterator. Enabling swiotlb is one such case that\ncan change the result. The nvme driver needs to save the mapped dma\nvectors to be unmapped later, so allocate as needed during iteration\nrather than assume it was always allocated at the beginning. This fixes\na NULL dereference from accessing an uninitialized dma_vecs when the\ndevice dma unmapping requirements change mid-iteration.",
