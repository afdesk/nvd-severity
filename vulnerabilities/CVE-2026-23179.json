  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-tcp: fixup hang in nvmet_tcp_listen_data_ready()\n\nWhen the socket is closed while in TCP_LISTEN a callback is run to\nflush all outstanding packets, which in turns calls\nnvmet_tcp_listen_data_ready() with the sk_callback_lock held.\nSo we need to check if we are in TCP_LISTEN before attempting\nto get the sk_callback_lock() to avoid a deadlock.",
