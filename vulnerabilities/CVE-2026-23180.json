  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndpaa2-switch: add bounds check for if_id in IRQ handler\n\nThe IRQ handler extracts if_id from the upper 16 bits of the hardware\nstatus register and uses it to index into ethsw->ports[] without\nvalidation. Since if_id can be any 16-bit value (0-65535) but the ports\narray is only allocated with sw_attr.num_ifs elements, this can lead to\nan out-of-bounds read potentially.\n\nAdd a bounds check before accessing the array, consistent with the\nexisting validation in dpaa2_switch_rx().",
