  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: fix oops due to invalid pointer for kfree() in parse_longname()\n\nThis fixes a kernel oops when reading ceph snapshot directories (.snap),\nfor example by simply running `ls /mnt/my_ceph/.snap`.\n\nThe variable str is guarded by __free(kfree), but advanced by one for\nskipping the initial '_' in snapshot names. Thus, kfree() is called\nwith an invalid pointer.  This patch removes the need for advancing the\npointer so kfree() is called with correct memory pointer.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create snapshots on a cephfs volume (I've 63 snaps in my testcase)\n\n2. Add cephfs mount to fstab\n$ echo \"samba-fileserver@.files=/volumes/datapool/stuff/3461082b-ecc9-4e82-8549-3fd2590d3fb6      /mnt/test/stuff   ceph     acl,noatime,_netdev    0       0\" >> /etc/fstab\n\n3. Reboot the system\n$ systemctl reboot\n\n4. Check if it's really mounted\n$ mount | grep stuff\n\n5. List snapshots (expected 63 snapshots on my system)\n$ ls /mnt/test/stuff/.snap\n\nNow ls hangs forever and the kernel log shows the oops.",
