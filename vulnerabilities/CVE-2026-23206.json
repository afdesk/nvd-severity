  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndpaa2-switch: prevent ZERO_SIZE_PTR dereference when num_ifs is zero\n\nThe driver allocates arrays for ports, FDBs, and filter blocks using\nkcalloc() with ethsw->sw_attr.num_ifs as the element count. When the\ndevice reports zero interfaces (either due to hardware configuration\nor firmware issues), kcalloc(0, ...) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR (0x10)\ninstead of NULL.\n\nLater in dpaa2_switch_probe(), the NAPI initialization unconditionally\naccesses ethsw->ports[0]->netdev, which attempts to dereference\nZERO_SIZE_PTR (address 0x10), resulting in a kernel panic.\n\nAdd a check to ensure num_ifs is greater than zero after retrieving\ndevice attributes. This prevents the zero-sized allocations and\nsubsequent invalid pointer dereference.",
