  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: tegra210-quad: Protect curr_xfer check in IRQ handler\n\nNow that all other accesses to curr_xfer are done under the lock,\nprotect the curr_xfer NULL check in tegra_qspi_isr_thread() with the\nspinlock. Without this protection, the following race can occur:\n\n  CPU0 (ISR thread)              CPU1 (timeout path)\n  ----------------               -------------------\n  if (!tqspi->curr_xfer)\n    // sees non-NULL\n                                 spin_lock()\n                                 tqspi->curr_xfer = NULL\n                                 spin_unlock()\n  handle_*_xfer()\n    spin_lock()\n    t = tqspi->curr_xfer  // NULL!\n    ... t->len ...        // NULL dereference!\n\nWith this patch, all curr_xfer accesses are now properly synchronized.\n\nAlthough all accesses to curr_xfer are done under the lock, in\ntegra_qspi_isr_thread() it checks for NULL, releases the lock and\nreacquires it later in handle_cpu_based_xfer()/handle_dma_based_xfer().\nThere is a potential for an update in between, which could cause a NULL\npointer dereference.\n\nTo handle this, add a NULL check inside the handlers after acquiring\nthe lock. This ensures that if the timeout path has already cleared\ncurr_xfer, the handler will safely return without dereferencing the\nNULL pointer.",
