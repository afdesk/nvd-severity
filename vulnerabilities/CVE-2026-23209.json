  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmacvlan: fix error recovery in macvlan_common_newlink()\n\nvalis provided a nice repro to crash the kernel:\n\nip link add p1 type veth peer p2\nip link set address 00:00:00:00:00:20 dev p1\nip link set up dev p1\nip link set up dev p2\n\nip link add mv0 link p2 type macvlan mode source\nip link add invalid% link p2 type macvlan mode source macaddr add 00:00:00:00:00:20\n\nping -c1 -I p1 1.2.3.4\n\nHe also gave a very detailed analysis:\n\n<quote valis>\n\nThe issue is triggered when a new macvlan link is created  with\nMACVLAN_MODE_SOURCE mode and MACVLAN_MACADDR_ADD (or\nMACVLAN_MACADDR_SET) parameter, lower device already has a macvlan\nport and register_netdevice() called from macvlan_common_newlink()\nfails (e.g. because of the invalid link name).\n\nIn this case macvlan_hash_add_source is called from\nmacvlan_change_sources() / macvlan_common_newlink():\n\nThis adds a reference to vlan to the port's vlan_source_hash using\nmacvlan_source_entry.\n\nvlan is a pointer to the priv data of the link that is being created.\n\nWhen register_netdevice() fails, the error is returned from\nmacvlan_newlink() to rtnl_newlink_create():\n\n        if (ops->newlink)\n                err = ops->newlink(dev, &params, extack);\n        else\n                err = register_netdevice(dev);\n        if (err < 0) {\n                free_netdev(dev);\n                goto out;\n        }\n\nand free_netdev() is called, causing a kvfree() on the struct\nnet_device that is still referenced in the source entry attached to\nthe lower device's macvlan port.\n\nNow all packets sent on the macvlan port with a matching source mac\naddress will trigger a use-after-free in macvlan_forward_source().\n\n</quote valis>\n\nWith all that, my fix is to make sure we call macvlan_flush_sources()\nregardless of @create value whenever \"goto destroy_macvlan_port;\"\npath is taken.\n\nMany thanks to valis for following up on this issue.",
