  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: iscsi: Fix use-after-free in iscsit_dec_conn_usage_count()\n\nIn iscsit_dec_conn_usage_count(), the function calls complete() while\nholding the conn->conn_usage_lock. As soon as complete() is invoked, the\nwaiter (such as iscsit_close_connection()) may wake up and proceed to free\nthe iscsit_conn structure.\n\nIf the waiter frees the memory before the current thread reaches\nspin_unlock_bh(), it results in a KASAN slab-use-after-free as the function\nattempts to release a lock within the already-freed connection structure.\n\nFix this by releasing the spinlock before calling complete().",
