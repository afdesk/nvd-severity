  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: trace: fix snapshot deadlock with sbi ecall\n\nIf sbi_ecall.c's functions are traceable,\n\necho \"__sbi_ecall:snapshot\" > /sys/kernel/tracing/set_ftrace_filter\n\nmay get the kernel into a deadlock.\n\n(Functions in sbi_ecall.c are excluded from tracing if\nCONFIG_RISCV_ALTERNATIVE_EARLY is set.)\n\n__sbi_ecall triggers a snapshot of the ringbuffer. The snapshot code\nraises an IPI interrupt, which results in another call to __sbi_ecall\nand another snapshot...\n\nAll it takes to get into this endless loop is one initial __sbi_ecall.\nOn RISC-V systems without SSTC extension, the clock events in\ntimer-riscv.c issue periodic sbi ecalls, making the problem easy to\ntrigger.\n\nAlways exclude the sbi_ecall.c functions from tracing to fix the\npotential deadlock.\n\nsbi ecalls can easiliy be logged via trace events, excluding ecall\nfunctions from function tracing is not a big limitation.",
