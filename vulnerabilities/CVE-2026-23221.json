  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: fsl-mc: fix use-after-free in driver_override_show()\n\nThe driver_override_show() function reads the driver_override string\nwithout holding the device_lock. However, driver_override_store() uses\ndriver_set_override(), which modifies and frees the string while holding\nthe device_lock.\n\nThis can result in a concurrent use-after-free if the string is freed\nby the store function while being read by the show function.\n\nFix this by holding the device_lock around the read operation.",
