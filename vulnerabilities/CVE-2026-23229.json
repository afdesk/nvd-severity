  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: virtio - Add spinlock protection with virtqueue notification\n\nWhen VM boots with one virtio-crypto PCI device and builtin backend,\nrun openssl benchmark command with multiple processes, such as\n  openssl speed -evp aes-128-cbc -engine afalg  -seconds 10 -multi 32\n\nopenssl processes will hangup and there is error reported like this:\n virtio_crypto virtio0: dataq.0:id 3 is not a head!\n\nIt seems that the data virtqueue need protection when it is handled\nfor virtio done notification. If the spinlock protection is added\nin virtcrypto_done_task(), openssl benchmark with multiple processes\nworks well.",
