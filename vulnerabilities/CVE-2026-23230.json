  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: split cached_fid bitfields to avoid shared-byte RMW races\n\nis_open, has_lease and on_list are stored in the same bitfield byte in\nstruct cached_fid but are updated in different code paths that may run\nconcurrently. Bitfield assignments generate byte read\u2013modify\u2013write\noperations (e.g. `orb $mask, addr` on x86_64), so updating one flag can\nrestore stale values of the others.\n\nA possible interleaving is:\n    CPU1: load old byte (has_lease=1, on_list=1)\n    CPU2: clear both flags (store 0)\n    CPU1: RMW store (old | IS_OPEN) -> reintroduces cleared bits\n\nTo avoid this class of races, convert these flags to separate bool\nfields.",
