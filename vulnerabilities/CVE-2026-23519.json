  "Description": "RustCrypto CMOV provides conditional move CPU intrinsics which are guaranteed on major platforms to execute in constant-time and not be rewritten as branches by the compiler. Prior to 0.4.4, the thumbv6m-none-eabi (Cortex M0, M0+ and M1) compiler emits non-constant time assembly when using cmovnz (portable version). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.4.",
