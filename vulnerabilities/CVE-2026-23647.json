  "Description": "Glory RBG-100 recycler systems using the ISPK-08 software component contain hard-coded operating system credentials that allow remote authentication to the underlying Linux system. Multiple local user accounts, including accounts with administrative privileges, were found to have fixed, embedded passwords. An attacker with network access to exposed services such as SSH may authenticate using these credentials and gain unauthorized access to the system. Successful exploitation allows remote access with elevated privileges and may result in full system compromise.",
