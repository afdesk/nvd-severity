  "Description": "Due to a Deserialization vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver (JMS service), an attacker authenticated as an administrator with local access could submit specially crafted content to the server. If processed by the application, this content could trigger unintended behavior during internal logic execution, potentially causing a denial of service. Successful exploitation results in a high impact on availability, while confidentiality and integrity remain unaffected.",
