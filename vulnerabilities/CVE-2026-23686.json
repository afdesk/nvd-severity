  "Description": "Due to a CRLF Injection vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java, an authenticated attacker with administrative access could submit specially crafted content to the application. If processed by the application, this content enables injection of untrusted entries into generated configuration, allowing manipulation of application-controlled settings. Successful exploitation leads to a low impact on integrity, while confidentiality and availability remain unaffected.",
