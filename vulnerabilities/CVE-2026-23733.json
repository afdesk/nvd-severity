  "Description": "LobeChat is an open source chat application platform. Prior to version 2.0.0-next.180, a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Mermaid artifact renderer allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the application context. This XSS can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by leveraging the exposed `electronAPI` IPC bridge, allowing attackers to run arbitrary system commands on the victim's machine. Version 2.0.0-next.180 patches the issue.",
