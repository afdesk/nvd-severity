  "Description": "GraphQL Modules is a toolset of libraries and guidelines dedicated to create reusable, maintainable, testable and extendable modules out of your GraphQL server. From 2.2.1 to before 2.4.1 and 3.1.1, when 2 or more parallel requests are made which trigger the same service, the context of the requests is mixed up in the service when the context is injected via @ExecutionContext(). ExecutionContext is often used to pass authentication tokens from incoming requests to services loading data from backend APIs. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.1 and 3.1.1.",
