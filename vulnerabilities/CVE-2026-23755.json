  "Description": "D-Link D-View 8 versions 2.0.1.107 and below contain an uncontrolled search path vulnerability in the installer. When executed with elevated privileges via UAC, the installer attempts to load version.dll from its execution directory, allowing DLL preloading. An attacker can supply a malicious version.dll alongside the legitimate installer so that, when a victim runs the installer and approves the UAC prompt, attacker-controlled code executes with administrator privileges. This can lead to full system compromise.",
