  "Description": "Mailpit is an email testing tool and API for developers. Versions prior to 1.28.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTML Check CSS Download. The HTML Check feature (`/api/v1/message/{ID}/html-check`) is designed to analyze HTML emails for compatibility. During this process, the `inlineRemoteCSS()` function automatically downloads CSS files from external `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"...\">` tags to inline them for testing. Version 1.28.3 fixes the issue.",
