  "Description": "SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Versions prior to 3.5.4 are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting in /api/icon/getDynamicIcon due to unsanitized SVG input. The endpoint generates SVG images for text icons (type=8). The content query parameter is inserted directly into the SVG <text> tag without XML escaping. Since the response Content-Type is image/svg+xml, injecting unescaped tags allows breaking the XML structure and executing JavaScript. Version 3.5.4 patches the issue.]",
