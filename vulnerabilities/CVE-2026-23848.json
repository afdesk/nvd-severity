  "Description": "MyTube is a self-hosted downloader and player for several video websites. Prior to version 1.7.71, a rate limiting bypass via `X-Forwarded-For` header spoofing allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass IP-based rate limiting on general API endpoints. Attackers can spoof client IPs by manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header, enabling unlimited requests to protected endpoints, including general API endpoints (enabling DoS) and other rate-limited functionality. Version 1.7.71 contains a patch for the issue.",
