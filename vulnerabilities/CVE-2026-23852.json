  "Description": "SiYuan is a personal knowledge management system. Versions prior to 3.5.4 have a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the `icon` attribute of a block via the `/api/attr/setBlockAttrs` API. The payload is later rendered in the dynamic icon feature in an unsanitized context, leading to stored XSS and, in the desktop environment, potential remote code execution (RCE). This issue bypasses the previous fix for issue `#15970` (XSS \u2192 RCE via dynamic icons). Version 3.5.4 contains an updated fix.",
