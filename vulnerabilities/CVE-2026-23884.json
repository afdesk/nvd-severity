  "Description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.21.0, offscreen bitmap deletion leaves `gdi->drawing` pointing to freed memory, causing UAF when related update packets arrive. A malicious server can trigger a client\u2011side use after free, causing a crash (DoS) and potential heap corruption with code\u2011execution risk depending on allocator behavior and surrounding heap layout. Version 3.21.0 contains a patch for the issue.",
