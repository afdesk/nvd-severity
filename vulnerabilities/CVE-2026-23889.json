  "Description": "pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.28.1, a path traversal vulnerability in pnpm's tarball extraction allows malicious packages to write files outside the package directory on Windows. The path normalization only checks for `./` but not `.\\`. On Windows, backslashes are directory separators, enabling path traversal. This vulnerability is Windows-only. This issue impacts Windows pnpm users and Windows CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions Windows runners, Azure DevOps). It can lead to overwriting `.npmrc`, build configs, or other files. Version 10.28.1 contains a patch.",
