  "Description": "pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.28.1, a path traversal vulnerability in pnpm's bin linking allows malicious npm packages to create executable shims or symlinks outside of `node_modules/.bin`. Bin names starting with `@` bypass validation, and after scope normalization, path traversal sequences like `../../` remain intact. This issue affects all pnpm users who install npm packages and CI/CD pipelines using pnpm. It can lead to overwriting config files, scripts, or other sensitive files. Version 10.28.1 contains a patch.",
