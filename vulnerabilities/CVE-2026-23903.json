  "Description": "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name vulnerability in Apache Shiro.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Shiro: before 2.0.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.7, which fixes the issue.\n\nThe issue only effects static files. If static files are served from a case-insensitive filesystem,\nsuch as default macOS setup, static files may be accessed by varying the case of the filename in the request.\nIf only lower-case (common default) filters are present in Shiro, they may be bypassed this way.\n\nShiro 2.0.7 and later has a new parameters to remediate this issue\nshiro.ini: filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true\napplication.propertie: shiro.caseInsensitive=true\n\nShiro 3.0.0 and later (upcoming) makes this the default.",
