  "Description": "ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Versions 14.10.1 and below have a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the MSL (Magick Scripting Language) parser when processing <comment> tags before images are loaded. This can lead to DoS attack due to assertion failure (debug builds) or NULL pointer dereference (release builds). This issue is fixed in version 14.10.2.",
