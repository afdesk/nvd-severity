  "Description": "Dataease is an open source data visualization analysis tool. Prior to version 2.10.19, DataEase uses the MD5 hash of the user\u2019s password as the JWT signing secret. This deterministic secret derivation allows an attacker to brute-force the admin\u2019s password by exploiting unmonitored API endpoints that verify JWT tokens. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.10.19. No known workarounds are available.",
