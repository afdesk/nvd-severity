Prior to versions 3.6.17 and 3.7.8, stored XSS in the artifact directory listing allows any workflow author to execute arbitrary JavaScript in another user\u2019s browser under the Argo Server origin, enabling API actions with the victim\u2019s privileges. Versions 3.6.17 and 3.7.8 fix the issue.",
