A private key recovery vulnerability exists in the SM2 decryption logic of sm-crypto prior to version 0.3.14. By interacting with the SM2 decryption interface multiple times, an attacker can fully recover the private key within approximately several hundred interactions. Version 0.3.14 patches the issue.",
