  "Description": "sm-crypto provides JavaScript implementations of the Chinese cryptographic algorithms SM2, SM3, and SM4. A signature malleability vulnerability exists in the SM2 signature verification logic of the sm-crypto library prior to version 0.3.14. An attacker can derive a new valid signature for a previously signed message from an existing signature. Version 0.3.14 patches the issue.",
