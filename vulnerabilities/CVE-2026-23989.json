  "Description": "REVA is an interoperability platform. Prior to 2.42.3 and 2.40.3, a bug in the GRPC authorization middleware of the \"Reva\" component of OpenCloud allows a malicious user to bypass the scope verification of a public link. By exploiting this via the the \"archiver\" service this can be leveraged to create an archive (zip or tar-file) containing all resources that this creator of the public link has access to. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.42.3 and 2.40.3.",
