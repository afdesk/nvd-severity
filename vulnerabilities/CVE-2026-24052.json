  "Description": "Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 1.0.111, Claude Code contained insufficient URL validation in its trusted domain verification mechanism for WebFetch requests. The application used a startsWith() function to validate trusted domains (e.g., docs.python.org, modelcontextprotocol.io), this could have enabled attackers to register domains like modelcontextprotocol.io.example.com that would pass validation. This could enable automatic requests to attacker-controlled domains without user consent, potentially leading to data exfiltration. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.111.",
