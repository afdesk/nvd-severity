  "Description": "Improper permission enforcement in Checkmk versions 2.4.0 before 2.4.0p21, 2.3.0 before 2.3.0p43, and 2.2.0 (EOL) allows users with the \"Use WATO\" permission to access the \"Analyze configuration\" page by directly navigating to its URL, bypassing the intended \"Access analyze configuration\" permission check. If these users also have the \"Make changes, perform actions\" permission, they can perform unauthorized actions such as disabling checks or acknowledging results.",
