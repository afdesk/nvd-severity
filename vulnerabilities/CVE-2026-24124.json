  "Description": "Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system. In versions 2.4.1-rc.0 and below, the Job API endpoints (/api/v1/jobs) lack JWT authentication middleware and RBAC authorization checks in the routing configuration. This allows any unauthenticated user with access to the Manager API to view, update and delete jobs. The issue is fixed in version 2.4.1-rc.1.",
