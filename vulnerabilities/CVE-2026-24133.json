  "Description": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.1.0, user control of the first argument of the addImage method results in denial of service. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized image data or URLs to the addImage method, a user can provide a harmful BMP file that results in out of memory errors and denial of service. Harmful BMP files have large width and/or height entries in their headers, which lead to excessive memory allocation. The html method is also affected. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.1.0.",
