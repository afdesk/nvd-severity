  "Description": "ChatterMate is a no-code AI chatbot agent framework. In versions 1.0.8 and below, the chatbot accepts and executes malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads when supplied as chat input. Specifically, an <iframe> payload containing a javascript: URI can be processed and executed in the browser context. This allows access to sensitive client-side data such as localStorage tokens and cookies, resulting in client-side injection. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.9.",
