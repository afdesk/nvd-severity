  "Description": "sigstore-python is a Python tool for generating and verifying Sigstore signatures. Prior to version 4.2.0, the sigstore-python OAuth authentication flow is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery. `_OAuthSession` creates a unique \"state\" and sends it as a parameter in the authentication request but the \"state\" in the server response seems not not be cross-checked with this value. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for the issue.",
