  "Description": "Emails sent by pretix can utilize placeholders that will be filled with customer data. For example, when {name}\n is used in an email template, it will  be replaced with the buyer's \nname for the final email. This mechanism contained a security-relevant bug:\n\nIt was possible to exfiltrate information about the pretix system through specially crafted placeholder names such as {{event.__init__.__code__.co_filename}}.\n This way, an attacker with the ability to control email templates \n(usually every user of the pretix backend) could retrieve sensitive \ninformation from the system configuration, including even database \npasswords or API keys. pretix does include mechanisms to prevent the usage of such \nmalicious placeholders, however due to a mistake in the code, they were \nnot fully effective for this plugin.\n\nOut of caution, we recommend that you rotate all passwords and API keys contained in your pretix.cfg\u00a0file.",
