  "Description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to 3.22.0, urb_select_interface can free the device's MS config on error but later code still dereferences it, leading to a use after free in libusb_udev_select_interface. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.22.0.",
