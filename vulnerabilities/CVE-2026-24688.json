  "Description": "pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker who uses an infinite loop vulnerability that is present in versions prior to 6.6.2 can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This requires accessing the outlines/bookmarks. This has been fixed in pypdf 6.6.2. If projects cannot upgrade yet, consider applying the changes from PR #3610 manually.",
