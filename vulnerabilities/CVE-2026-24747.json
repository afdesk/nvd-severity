  "Description": "PyTorch is a Python package that provides tensor computation. Prior to version 2.10.0, a vulnerability in PyTorch's `weights_only` unpickler allows an attacker to craft a malicious checkpoint file (`.pth`) that, when loaded with `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`, can corrupt memory and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. Version 2.10.0 fixes the issue.",
