  "Description": "OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot) is a personal AI assistant users run on their own devices. In versions 2026.2.2 and below, when the Slack integration is enabled, channel metadata (topic/description) can be incorporated into the model's system prompt. Prompt injection is a documented risk for LLM-driven systems. This issue increases the injection surface by allowing untrusted Slack channel metadata to be treated as higher-trust system input. This issue has been fixed in version 2026.2.3.",
