  "Description": "Podman Desktop is a graphical tool for developing on containers and Kubernetes. A critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Podman Desktop prior to version 1.25.1 allows any extension to completely circumvent permission checks and gain unauthorized access to all authentication sessions. The `isAccessAllowed()` function unconditionally returns `true`, enabling malicious extensions to impersonate any user, hijack authentication sessions, and access sensitive resources without authorization. This vulnerability affects all versions of Podman Desktop. Version 1.25.1 contains a patch for the issue.",
