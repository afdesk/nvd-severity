  "Description": "`bulk_extractor` is a digital forensics exploitation tool. Starting in version 1.4, `bulk_extractor`\u2019s embedded unrar code has a heap\u2011buffer\u2011overflow in the RAR PPM LZ decoding path. A crafted RAR inside a disk image causes an out\u2011of\u2011bounds write in `Unpack::CopyString`, leading to a crash under ASAN (and likely a crash or memory corruption in production builds). There's potential for using this for RCE. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.",
