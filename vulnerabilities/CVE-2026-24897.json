  "Description": "Erugo is a self-hosted file-sharing platform. In versions up to and including 0.2.14, an authenticated low-privileged user can upload arbitrary files to any specified location due to insufficient validation of user\u2011supplied paths when creating shares.\nBy specifying a writable path within the public web root, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, resulting in remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to fully compromise the affected Erugo instance. Version 0.2.15 fixes the issue.",
