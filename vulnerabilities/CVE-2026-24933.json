  "Description": "The API communication component fails to validate the SSL/TLS certificate when sending HTTPS requests to the server. An improper certificates validation vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to intercept the cleartext communication, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive user information, including account emails, MD5 hashed passwords, and device serial numbers.\n\n\nAffected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 through ADM 4.3.3.ROF1 as well as from ADM 5.0.0 through ADM 5.1.1.RCI1.",
