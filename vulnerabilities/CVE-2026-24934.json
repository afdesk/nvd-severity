  "Description": "The DDNS function uses an insecure HTTP connection or fails to validate the SSL/TLS certificate when querying an external server for the device's WAN IP address. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to spoof the response, leading the device to update its DDNS record with an incorrect IP address.\nAffected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 through ADM 4.3.3.ROF1 as well as from ADM 5.0.0 through ADM 5.1.1.RCI1.",
