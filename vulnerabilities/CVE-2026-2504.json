  "Description": "The Dealia \u2013 Request a quote plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability checks on multiple AJAX handlers in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. The admin nonce (DEALIA_ADMIN_NONCE) is exposed to all users with edit_posts capability (Contributor+) via wp_localize_script() in PostsController.php, while the AJAX handlers in AdminSettingsController.php only verify the nonce without checking current_user_can('manage_options'). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to reset the plugin configuration.",
