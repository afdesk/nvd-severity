  "Description": "Kimi Agent SDK is a set of libraries that expose the Kimi Code (Kimi CLI) agent runtime in applications. The vsix-publish.js and ovsx-publish.js scripts pass filenames to execSync() as shell command strings. Prior to version 0.1.6, filenames containing shell metacharacters like $(cmd) could execute arbitrary commands. Note: This vulnerability exists only in the repository's development scripts. The published VSCode extension does not include these files and end users are not affected. This is fixed in version 0.1.6 by replacing execSync with execFileSync using array arguments. As a workaround, ensure .vsix files in the project directory have safe filenames before running publish scripts.",
