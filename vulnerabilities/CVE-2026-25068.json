  "Description": "alsa-lib versions 1.2.2 up to and including 1.2.15.2, prior to commit 5f7fe33, contain a heap-based buffer overflow in the topology mixer control decoder. The tplg_decode_control_mixer1() function reads the num_channels field from untrusted .tplg data and uses it as a loop bound without validating it against the fixed-size channel array (SND_TPLG_MAX_CHAN). A crafted topology file with an excessive num_channels value can cause out-of-bounds heap writes, leading to a crash.",
