  "Description": "Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. In versions 0.13.4 and below, the DeleteComment API does not verify that the comment belongs to the repository specified in the URL. This allows a repository administrator to delete comments from any other repository by supplying arbitrary comment IDs, bypassing authorization controls. The DeleteComment function retrieves a comment by ID without verifying repository ownership and the Database function DeleteCommentByID performs no repository validation. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.0.",
