  "Description": "PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. Prior to version 0-PRERELEASE-15, the vote API route (`POST /api/v1/forum/vote`) trusts the JSON body\u2019s `direction` value without runtime validation. TypeScript types are not enforced at runtime, so an attacker can send arbitrary strings (e.g., `\"x\"`) as `direction`. Downstream (`VoteServer`) treats any non-`\"up\"` and non-`null` value as a downvote and persists the invalid value in `votes_data`. This can be exploited to bypass intended business logic. Version 0-PRERELEASE-15 fixes the vulnerability.",
