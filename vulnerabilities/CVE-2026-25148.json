  "Description": "Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. Prior to version 1.19.0, a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Qwik.js' server-side rendering virtual attribute serialization allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into server-rendered pages via virtual attributes.
