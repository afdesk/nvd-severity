  "Description": "PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. In 0-PRERELEASE-15 and earlier, the OAuth 2.0 implementation for GitHub and Google login providers is vulnerable to Login Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application fails to implement and verify the state parameter during the authentication flow. This allows an attacker to pre-authenticate a session and trick a victim into logging into the attacker's account. Any data the victim then enters or academic progress they make is stored on the attacker's account, leading to data loss for the victim and information disclosure to the attacker.",
