  "Description": "The Micca KE700 system contains flawed resynchronization logic and is vulnerable to replay attacks. This attack requires sending two previously captured codes in a specific sequence. As a result, the system can be forced to accept previously used (stale) rolling codes and execute a command. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to clone the alarm key. This grants the attacker unauthorized access to the vehicle to unlock or lock the doors.",
