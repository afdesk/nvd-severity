  "Description": "The Micca KE700 system relies on a 6-bit portion of an identifier for authentication within rolling codes, providing only 64 possible combinations. This low entropy allows an attacker to perform a brute-force attack against one component of the rolling code. Successful exploitation simplify an attacker to predict the next valid rolling code, granting unauthorized access to the vehicle.",
