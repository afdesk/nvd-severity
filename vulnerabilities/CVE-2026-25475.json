  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.1.30, the isValidMedia() function in src/media/parse.ts allows arbitrary file paths including absolute paths, home directory paths, and directory traversal sequences. An agent can read any file on the system by outputting MEDIA:/path/to/file, exfiltrating sensitive data to the user/channel. This issue has been patched in version 2026.1.30.",
