  "Description": "Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to 2.20.0, CORSConfig.allowed_origins_regex is constructed using a regex built from configured allowlist values and used with fullmatch() for validation. Because metacharacters are not escaped, a malicious origin can match unexpectedly. The check relies on allowed_origins_regex.fullmatch(origin). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.20.0.",
