  "Description": "Langroid is a framework for building large-language-model-powered applications. Prior to version 0.59.32, there is a bypass to the fix for CVE-2025-46724. TableChatAgent can call pandas_eval tool to evaluate the expression. There is a WAF in langroid/utils/pandas_utils.py introduced to block code injection CVE-2025-46724. However it can be bypassed due to _literal_ok() returning False instead of raising UnsafeCommandError on invalid input, combined with unrestricted access to dangerous dunder attributes (__init__, __globals__, __builtins__). This allows chaining whitelisted DataFrame methods to leak the eval builtin and execute arbitrary code. This issue has been patched in version 0.59.32.",
