  "Description": "Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences.  In Craft versions 4.0.0-RC1 through 4.16.17 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.21, the saveAsset GraphQL mutation uses filter_var(..., FILTER_VALIDATE_IP) to block a specific list of IP addresses. However, alternative IP notations (hexadecimal, mixed) are not recognized by this function, allowing attackers to bypass the blocklist and access cloud metadata services. This issue is patched in versions 4.16.18 and 5.8.22.",
