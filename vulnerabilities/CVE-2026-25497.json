  "Description": "Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In Craft versions from 4.0.0-RC1 to before 4.17.0-beta.1 and 5.9.0-beta.1, there is a Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Craft CMS\u2019s GraphQL API that allows an authenticated user with write access to one asset volume to escalate their privileges and modify/transfer assets belonging to any other volume, including restricted or private volumes to which they should not have access. The saveAsset GraphQL mutation validates authorization against the schema-resolved volume but fetches the target asset by ID without verifying that the asset belongs to the authorized volume. This allows unauthorized cross-volume asset modification and transfer. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.17.0-beta.1 and 5.9.0-beta.1.",
