  "Description": "Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In versions 4.0.0-RC1 through 4.16.17 and 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.21, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Craft CMS where the assembleLayoutFromPost() function in src/services/Fields.php fails to sanitize user-supplied configuration data before passing it to Craft::createObject(). This allows authenticated administrators to inject malicious Yii2 behavior configurations that execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This vulnerability represents an unpatched variant of the behavior injection vulnerability addressed in CVE-2025-68455, affecting different endpoints through a separate code path. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.8.22.",
