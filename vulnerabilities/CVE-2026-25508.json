  "Description": "ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability was reported in the BLE ATT Prepare Write handling of the BLE provisioning transport (protocomm_ble). The issue can be triggered by a remote BLE client while the device is in provisioning mode. The transport accumulated prepared-write fragments in a fixed-size buffer but incorrectly tracked the cumulative length. By sending repeated prepare write requests with overlapping offsets, a remote client could cause the reported length to exceed the allocated buffer size. This inflated length was then passed to provisioning handlers during execute-write processing, resulting in an out-of-bounds read and potential memory corruption. This issue has been patched in versions 5.5.3, 5.4.4, 5.3.5, 5.2.7, and 5.1.7.",
