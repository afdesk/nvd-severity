  "Description": "FacturaScripts is open-source enterprise resource planning and accounting software. Prior to version 2025.81, FacturaScripts contains a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the REST API that allows authenticated API users to execute arbitrary SQL queries through the sort parameter. The vulnerability exists in the ModelClass::getOrderBy() method where user-supplied sorting parameters are directly concatenated into the SQL ORDER BY clause without validation or sanitization. This affects all API endpoints that support sorting functionality. This issue has been patched in version 2025.81.",
