  "Description": "NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. The ui.markdown() component uses the markdown2 library to convert markdown content to HTML, which is then rendered via innerHTML. By default, markdown2 allows raw HTML to pass through unchanged. This means that if an application renders user-controlled content through ui.markdown(), an attacker can inject malicious HTML containing JavaScript event handlers. Unlike other NiceGUI components that render HTML (ui.html(), ui.chat_message(), ui.interactive_image()), the ui.markdown() component does not provide or require a sanitize parameter, leaving applications vulnerable to XSS attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.7.0.",
