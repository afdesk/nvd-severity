  "Description": "Locutus brings stdlibs of other programming languages to JavaScript for educational purposes. In versions from 2.0.12 to before 2.0.39, a prototype pollution vulnerability exists in locutus. Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using String.prototype. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.39.",
