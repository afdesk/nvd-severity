  "Description": "JinJava is a Java-based template engine based on django template syntax, adapted to render jinja templates. Prior to versions 2.7.6 and 2.8.3, JinJava is vulnerable to arbitrary Java execution via bypass through ForTag. This allows arbitrary Java class instantiation and file access bypassing built-in sandbox restrictions. This issue has been patched in versions 2.7.6 and 2.8.3.",
