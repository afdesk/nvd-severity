  "Description": "ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, a vulnerability exists in the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) Enrollee implementation where malformed EAP-WSC packets with truncated payloads can cause integer underflow during fragment length calculation. When processing EAP-Expanded (WSC) messages, the code computes frag_len by subtracting header sizes from the total packet length. If an attacker sends a packet where the EAP Length field covers only the header and flags but omits the expected payload (such as the 2-byte Message Length field when WPS_MSG_FLAG_LEN is set), frag_len becomes negative. This negative value is then implicitly cast to size_t when passed to wpabuf_put_data(), resulting in a very large unsigned value. This issue has been patched in versions 5.5.3, 5.4.4, 5.3.5, 5.2.7, and 5.1.7.",
