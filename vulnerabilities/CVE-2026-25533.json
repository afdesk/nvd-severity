  "Description": "Enclave is a secure JavaScript sandbox designed for safe AI agent code execution. Prior to 2.10.1, the existing layers of security in enclave-vm are insufficient: The AST sanitization can be bypassed with dynamic property accesses, the hardening of the error objects does not cover the peculiar behavior or the vm module and the function constructor access prevention can be side-stepped by leveraging host object references. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.10.1.",
