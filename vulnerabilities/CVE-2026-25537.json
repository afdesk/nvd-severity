  "Description": "jsonwebtoken is a JWT lib in rust. Prior to version 10.3.0, there is a Type Confusion vulnerability in jsonwebtoken, specifically, in its claim validation logic. When a standard claim (such as nbf or exp) is provided with an incorrect JSON type (Like a String instead of a Number), the library\u2019s internal parsing mechanism marks the claim as \u201cFailedToParse\u201d. Crucially, the validation logic treats this \u201cFailedToParse\u201d state identically to \u201cNotPresent\u201d. This means that if a check is enabled (like: validate_nbf = true), but the claim is not explicitly marked as required in required_spec_claims, the library will skip the validation check entirely for the malformed claim, treating it as if it were not there. This allows attackers to bypass critical time-based security restrictions (like \u201cNot Before\u201d checks) and commit potential authentication and authorization bypasses. This issue has been patched in version 10.3.0.",
