  "Description": "NavigaTUM is a website and API to search for rooms, buildings and other places. Prior to commit 86f34c7, there is a path traversal vulnerability in the propose_edits endpoint allows unauthenticated users to overwrite files in directories writable by the application user (e.g., /cdn). By supplying unsanitized file keys containing traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) in the JSON payload, an attacker can escape the intended temporary directory and replace public facing images or fill the server's storage. This issue has been patched via commit 86f34c7.",
