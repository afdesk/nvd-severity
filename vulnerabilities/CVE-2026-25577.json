  "Description": "Emmett is a framework designed to simplify your development process. Prior to 1.3.11, the cookies property in mmett_core.http.wrappers.Request does not handle CookieError exceptions when parsing malformed Cookie headers. This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger HTTP 500 errors and cause denial of service. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.3.11.",
