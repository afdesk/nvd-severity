  "Description": "SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Prior to 0.8.29, a sandbox escape is possible by shadowing hasOwnProperty on a sandbox object, which disables prototype whitelist enforcement in the property-access path. This permits direct access to __proto__ and other blocked prototype properties, enabling host Object.prototype pollution and persistent cross-sandbox impact. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.29.",
