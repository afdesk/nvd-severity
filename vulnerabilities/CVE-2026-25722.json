  "Description": "Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.57, Claude Code failed to properly validate directory changes when combined with write operations to protected folders. By using the cd command to navigate into sensitive directories like .claude, it was possible to bypass write protection and create or modify files without user confirmation. Reliably exploiting this required the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.57.",
