  "Description": "Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Prior to version 2.0.55, Claude Code failed to properly validate commands using piped sed operations with the echo command, allowing attackers to bypass file write restrictions. This vulnerability enabled writing to sensitive directories like the .claude folder and paths outside the project scope. Exploiting this required the ability to execute commands through Claude Code with the \"accept edits\" feature enabled. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.55.",
