  "Description": "FUXA is a web-based Process Visualization (SCADA/HMI/Dashboard) software. An authorization bypass vulnerability in FUXA allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify device tags via WebSockets. Exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass role-based access controls and overwrite arbitrary device tags or disable communication drivers, exposing connected ICS/SCADA environments to follow-on actions. This may allow an attacker to manipulate physical processes and disconnected devices from the HMI. This affects FUXA through version 1.2.9. This issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.10.",
