  "Description": "Sliver is a command and control framework that uses a custom Wireguard netstack. Prior to 1.7.0, the DNS C2 listener accepts unauthenticated TOTP bootstrap messages and allocates server-side DNS sessions without validating OTP values, even when EnforceOTP is enabled. Because sessions are stored without a cleanup/expiry path in this flow, an unauthenticated remote actor can repeatedly create sessions and drive memory exhaustion. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.0.",
