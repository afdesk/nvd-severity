  "Description": "Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool. In versions from 1.7.0 to 1.10.2, when using P256 certificates (which is not the default configuration), it is possible to evade a blocklist entry created against the fingerprint of a certificate by using ECDSA Signature Malleability to use a copy of the certificate with a different fingerprint. This issue has been patched in version 1.10.3.",
