  "Description": "Fortinet FortiOS through 7.6.6 allows attackers to decrypt LDAP credentials stored in device configuration files, as exploited in the wild from 2025-12-16 through 2026 (by default, the encryption key is the same across all customers' installations). NOTE: the Supplier's position is that the instance of CWE-1394 is not a vulnerability because customers \"are supposed to enable\" a non-default option that eliminates the weakness. However, that non-default option can disrupt functionality as shown in the \"Managing FortiGates with private data encryption\" document, and is therefore intentionally not a default option.",
