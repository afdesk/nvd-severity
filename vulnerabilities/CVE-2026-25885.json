  "Description": "PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. In 0-PRERELEASE-16 and earlier, the group chat WebSocket at wss://polarlearn.nl/api/v1/ws can be used without logging in. An unauthenticated client can subscribe to any group chat by providing a group UUID, and can also send messages to any group. The server accepts the message and stores it in the group\u2019s chatContent, so this is not just a visual spam issue.",
