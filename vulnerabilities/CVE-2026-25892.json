  "Description": "Adminer is open-source database management software. Adminer v5.4.1 and earlier has a version check mechanism where adminer.org sends signed version info via JavaScript postMessage, which the browser then POSTs to ?script=version. This endpoint lacks origin validation and accepts POST data from any source. An attacker can POST version[] parameter which PHP converts to an array. On next page load, openssl_verify() receives this array instead of string and throws TypeError, returning HTTP 500 to all users. Upgrade to Adminer 5.4.2.",
