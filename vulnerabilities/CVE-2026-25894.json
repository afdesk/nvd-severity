  "Description": "FUXA is a web-based Process Visualization (SCADA/HMI/Dashboard) software. An insecure default configuration in FUXA allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative access and execute arbitrary code on the server. This affects FUXA through version 1.2.9 when authentication is enabled, but the administrator JWT secret is not configured. This issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.10.",
