Prior to 20260208.1, the application fails to filter the phar:// protocol in URL validation, allowing attackers to upload a malicious Phar Polyglot file (disguised as JPEG) via the image upload feature, trigger Phar deserialization through BBCode [img] tag processing, and exploit Smarty 4.1.0 POP chain to achieve arbitrary file deletion.
