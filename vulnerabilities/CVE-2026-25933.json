  "Description": "Arduino App Lab is a cross-platform IDE for developing Arduino Apps. Prior to 0.4.0, a vulnerability was identified in the Terminal component of the arduino-app-lab application. The issue stems from insufficient sanitization and validation of input data received from connected hardware devices, specifically in the _info.Serial and _info.Address metadata fields. The problem occurs during device information handling. When a board is connected, the application collects identifying attributes to establish a terminal session. Because strict validation is not enforced for the Serial and Address parameters, an attacker with control over the connected hardware can supply specially crafted strings containing shell metacharacters. The exploitation requires direct physical access to a previously tampered board. When the host system processes these fields, any injected payload is executed with the privileges of the user running arduino-app-lab. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.",
