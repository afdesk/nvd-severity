  "Description": "EverShop is a TypeScript-first eCommerce platform. During category update and deletion event handling, the application embeds\npath / request_path values\u2014derived from the url_key stored in the database\u2014into SQL statements via string concatenation and passes them to execute(). As a result, if a malicious string is stored in url_key , subsequent event processing modifies and executes the SQL statement, leading to a second-order SQL injection. Patched from v2.1.1.",
