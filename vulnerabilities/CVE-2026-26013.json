  "Description": "LangChain is a framework for building agents and LLM-powered applications. Prior to 1.2.11, the ChatOpenAI.get_num_tokens_from_messages() method fetches arbitrary image_url values without validation when computing token counts for vision-enabled models. This allows attackers to trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by providing malicious image URLs in user input. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.11.",
