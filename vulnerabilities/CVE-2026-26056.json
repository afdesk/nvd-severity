  "Description": "Yoke is a Helm-inspired infrastructure-as-code (IaC) package deployer. In 0.19.0 and earlier, a vulnerability exists in the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) component of Yoke. It allows users with CR create/update permissions to execute arbitrary WASM code in the ATC controller context by injecting a malicious URL through the overrides.yoke.cd/flight annotation. The ATC controller downloads and executes the WASM module without proper URL validation, enabling attackers to create arbitrary Kubernetes resources or potentially escalate privileges to cluster-admin level.",
