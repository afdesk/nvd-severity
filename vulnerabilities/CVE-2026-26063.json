  "Description": "CediPay is a crypto-to-fiat app for the Ghanaian market. A vulnerability in CediPay prior to version 1.2.3 allows attackers to bypass input validation in the transaction API. The issue has been fixed in version 1.2.3. If upgrading is not immediately possible, restrict API access to trusted networks or IP ranges; enforce strict input validation at the application layer; and/or monitor transaction logs for anomalies or suspicious activity. These mitigations reduce exposure but do not fully eliminate the vulnerability.",
