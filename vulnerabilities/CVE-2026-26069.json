  "Description": "Scraparr is a Prometheus Exporter for various components of the *arr Suite. From 3.0.0-beta to before 3.0.2, when the Readarr integration was enabled, the exporter exposed the configured Readarr API key as the alias metric label value. Users were affected only if all of the following conditions are met, Readarr scraping feature was enabled and no alias configured, the exporter\u2019s /metrics endpoint was accessible to external or unauthorized users, and the Readarr instance is externally accessible. If the /metrics endpoint was publicly accessible, the Readarr API key could have been disclosed via exported metrics data. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.2.",
