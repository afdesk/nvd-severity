  "Description": "emp3r0r is a C2 designed by Linux users for Linux environments. Prior to version 3.21.2, multiple shared maps are accessed without consistent synchronization across goroutines. Under concurrent activity, Go runtime can trigger `fatal error: concurrent map read and map write`, causing C2 process crash (availability loss). Version 3.21.2 fixes this issue.",
