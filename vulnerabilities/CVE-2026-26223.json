  "Description": "SPIP before 4.4.8 allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the private area via malicious iframe tags. The application does not properly sandbox or escape iframe content in the back-office, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts. The fix adds a sandbox attribute to iframe tags in the private area. This vulnerability is not mitigated by the SPIP security screen.",
