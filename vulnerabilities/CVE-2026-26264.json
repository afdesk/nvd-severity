  "Description": "BACnet Stack is a BACnet open source protocol stack C library for embedded systems. Prior to 1.5.0rc4 and 1.4.3rc2, a malformed WriteProperty request can trigger a length underflow in the BACnet stack, leading to an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read and a crash (DoS). The issue is in wp.c within wp_decode_service_request. When decoding the optional priority context tag, the code passes apdu_len - apdu_size to bacnet_unsigned_context_decode without validating that apdu_size <= apdu_len. If a truncated APDU reaches this path, apdu_len - apdu_size underflows, resulting in a large size being used for decoding and an out\u2011of\u2011bounds read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.0rc4 and 1.4.3rc2.",
