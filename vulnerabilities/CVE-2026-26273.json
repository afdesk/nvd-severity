  "Description": "Known is a social publishing platform. Prior to 1.6.3, a Critical Broken Authentication vulnerability exists in Known 1.6.2 and earlier. The application leaks the password reset token within a hidden HTML input field on the password reset page. This allows any unauthenticated attacker to retrieve the reset token for any user by simply querying the user's email, leading to full Account Takeover (ATO) without requiring access to the victim's email inbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.3.",
