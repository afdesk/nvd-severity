  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Feishu extension previously allowed `sendMediaFeishu` to treat attacker-controlled `mediaUrl` values as local filesystem paths and read them directly. If an attacker can influence tool calls (directly or via prompt injection), they may be able to exfiltrate local files by supplying paths such as `/etc/passwd` as `mediaUrl`. Upgrade to OpenClaw `2026.2.14` or newer to receive a fix. The fix removes direct local file reads from this path and routes media loading through hardened helpers that enforce local-root restrictions.",
