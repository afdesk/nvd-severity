  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, OpenClaw's SSRF protection could be bypassed using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals such as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` (which is `127.0.0.1`). This could allow requests that should be blocked (loopback / private network / link-local metadata) to pass the SSRF guard. Version 2026.2.14 patches the issue.",
