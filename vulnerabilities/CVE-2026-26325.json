  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, a mismatch between `rawCommand` and `command[]` in the node host `system.run` handler could cause allowlist/approval evaluation to be performed on one command while executing a different argv. This only impacts deployments that use the node host / companion node execution path (`system.run` on a node), enable allowlist-based exec policy (`security=allowlist`) with approval prompting driven by allowlist misses (for example `ask=on-miss`), allow an attacker to invoke `system.run`. Default/non-node configurations are not affected. Version 2026.2.14 enforces `rawCommand`/`command[]` consistency (gateway fail-fast + node host validation).",
