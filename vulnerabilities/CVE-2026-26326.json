  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, `skills.status` could disclose secrets to `operator.read` clients by returning raw resolved config values in `configChecks` for skill `requires.config` paths. Version 2026.2.14 stops including raw resolved config values in requirement checks (return only `{ path, satisfied }`) and narrows the Discord skill requirement to the token key. In addition to upgrading, users should rotate any Discord tokens that may have been exposed to read-scoped clients.",
