  "Description": "Calero VeraSMART versions prior to\u00a02022 R1 expose an unauthenticated .NET Remoting HTTP service on TCP port 8001. The service publishes default ObjectURIs (including EndeavorServer.rem and RemoteFileReceiver.rem) and permits the use of SOAP and binary formatters with TypeFilterLevel set to Full. An unauthenticated remote attacker can invoke the exposed remoting endpoints to perform arbitrary file read and write operations via the WebClient class. This allows retrieval of sensitive files such as WebRoot\\\\web.config, which may disclose IIS machineKey validation and decryption keys. An attacker can use these keys to generate a malicious ASP.NET ViewState payload and achieve remote code execution within the IIS application context. Additionally, supplying a UNC path can trigger outbound SMB authentication from the service account, potentially exposing NTLMv2 hashes for relay or offline cracking.",
