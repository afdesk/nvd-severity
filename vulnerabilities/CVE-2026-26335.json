  "Description": "Calero VeraSMART versions prior to\u00a02022 R1 use static ASP.NET/IIS machineKey values configured for the VeraSMART web application and stored in C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Veramark\\\\VeraSMART\\\\WebRoot\\\\web.config. An attacker who obtains these keys can craft a valid ASP.NET ViewState payload that passes integrity validation and is accepted by the application, resulting in server-side deserialization and remote code execution in the context of the IIS application.",
