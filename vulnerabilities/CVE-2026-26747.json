  "Description": "A Host Header Poisoning vulnerability exists in Monica 4.1.2 due to improper handling of the HTTP Host header in app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php, combined with the default misconfiguration where the \"app.force_url\" is not set and default is \"false\". The application generates absolute URLs (such as those used in password reset emails) using the user-supplied Host header. This allows remote attackers to poison the password reset link sent to a victim,",
