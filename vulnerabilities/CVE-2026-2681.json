  "Description": "A flaw was found in the blst cryptographic library. This out-of-bounds stack write vulnerability, specifically in the blst_sha256_bcopy assembly routine, occurs due to a missing zero-length guard. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a zero-length salt parameter to key generation functions, such as blst_keygen_v5(), if the application exposes this functionality. Successful exploitation leads to memory corruption and immediate process termination, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
