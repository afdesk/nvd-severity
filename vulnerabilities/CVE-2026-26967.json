  "Description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. In versions 2.16 and below, there is a critical Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in PJSIP's H.264 unpacketizer. The bug occurs when processing malformed SRTP packets, where the unpacketizer reads a 2-byte NAL unit size field without validating that both bytes are within the payload buffer bounds. The vulnerability affects applications that receive video using H.264. A patch is available at https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/f821c214e52b11bae11e4cd3c7f0864538fb5491.",
