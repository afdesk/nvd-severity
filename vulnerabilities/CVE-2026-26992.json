  "Description": "LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. In versions 26.1.1 and below, the port group name is not sanitized, allowing attackers with admin privileges to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. When a user adds a port group, an HTTP POST request is sent to the Request-URI \"/port-groups\". The name of the newly created port group is stored in the value of the name parameter. After the port group is created, the entry is displayed along with relevant buttons such as Edit and Delete. This issue has been fixed in version 26.2.0.",
