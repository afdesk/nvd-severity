  "Description": "Flare is a Next.js-based, self-hostable file sharing platform that integrates with screenshot tools. Versions 1.7.0 and below allow users to upload files without proper content validation or sanitization. By embedding malicious JavaScript within an SVG (or other active content formats such as HTML or XML), an attacker can achieve script execution in the context of the application's origin when a victim views the file in \u201craw\u201d mode. This results in a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited to exfiltrate user data. This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.1.",
