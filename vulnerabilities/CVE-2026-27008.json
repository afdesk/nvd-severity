  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, a bug in `download` skill installation allowed `targetDir` values from skill frontmatter to resolve outside the per-skill tools directory if not strictly validated. In the admin-only `skills.install` flow, this could write files outside the intended install sandbox. Version 2026.2.15 contains a fix for the issue.",
