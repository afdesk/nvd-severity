  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, a atored XSS issue in the OpenClaw Control UI when rendering assistant identity (name/avatar) into an inline `<script>` tag without script-context-safe escaping. A crafted value containing `</script>` could break out of the script tag and execute attacker-controlled JavaScript in the Control UI origin. Version 2026.2.15 removed inline script injection and serve bootstrap config from a JSON endpoint and added a restrictive Content Security Policy for the Control UI (`script-src 'self'`, no inline scripts).",
