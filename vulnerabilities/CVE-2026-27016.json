  "Description": "LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Versions 24.10.0 through 26.1.1 are vulnerable to Stored XSS via the unit parameter in Custom OID. The Custom OID functionality lacks strip_tags() sanitization while other fields (name, oid, datatype) are sanitized. The unsanitized value is stored in the database and rendered without HTML escaping. This issue is fixed in version 26.2.0.",
