  "Description": "@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-redis is the Redis checkpoint and store implementation for LangGraph. A query injection vulnerability exists in the @langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-redis package's filter handling. The RedisSaver and ShallowRedisSaver classes construct RediSearch queries by directly interpolating user-provided filter keys and values without proper escaping. RediSearch has special syntax characters that can modify query behavior, and when user-controlled data contains these characters, the query logic can be manipulated to bypass intended access controls. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.2.",
