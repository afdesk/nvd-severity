  "Description": "svelte performance oriented web framework. Prior to 5.51.5, in server-side rendering, attribute spreading on elements (e.g. <div {...attrs}>) enumerates inherited properties from the object's prototype chain rather than only own properties. In environments where Object.prototype has already been polluted \u2014 a precondition outside of Svelte's control \u2014 this can cause unexpected attributes to appear in SSR output or cause SSR to throw errors. Client-side rendering is not affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.51.5.",
