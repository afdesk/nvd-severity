  "Description": "MajorDoMo (aka Major Domestic Module) is vulnerable to unauthenticated OS command injection via rc/index.php. The $param variable from user input is interpolated into a command string within double quotes without sanitization via escapeshellarg(). The command is inserted into a database queue by safe_exec(), which performs no sanitization. The cycle_execs.php script, which is web-accessible without authentication, retrieves queued commands and passes them directly to exec(). An attacker can exploit a race condition by first triggering cycle_execs.php (which purges the queue and enters a polling loop), then injecting a malicious command via the rc endpoint while the worker is polling. The injected shell metacharacters expand inside double quotes, achieving remote code execution within one second.",
