  "Description": "The Dealia \u2013 Request a Quote plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Gutenberg block attributes in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to the use of `wp_kses()` for output escaping within HTML attribute contexts where `esc_attr()` is required. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
