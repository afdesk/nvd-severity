  "Description": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. In versions 2026.2.17 and below, the Discord moderation action handling (timeout, kick, ban) uses sender identity from request parameters in tool-driven flows, instead of trusted runtime sender context. In setups where Discord moderation actions are enabled and the bot has the necessary guild permissions, a non-admin user can request moderation actions by spoofing sender identity fields. This issue has been fixed in version 2026.2.18.",
