  "Description": "SVXportal version 2.5 and prior contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the user registration workflow (index.php submitting to admin/user_action.php). User-supplied fields such as Firstname, lastname, and email are stored in the backend database without adequate output encoding and are later rendered in the administrator interface (admin/users.php), allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in an administrator's browser upon viewing the affected page.",
