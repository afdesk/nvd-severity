  "Description": "CollabPlatform is a full-stack, real-time doc collaboration platform. In all versions of CollabPlatform, the Appwrite project used by the application is misconfigured to allow arbitrary origins in CORS responses while also permitting credentialed requests. An attacker-controlled domain can issue authenticated cross-origin requests and read sensitive user account information, including email address, account identifiers, and MFA status. The issue did not have a fix at the time of publication.",
